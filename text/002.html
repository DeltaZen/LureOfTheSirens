<p class="msonormal4" id="calibre_pb_4"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="Start"></a>You enter the smoky, grimy, neon lit interior of the bar. It’s
been a while since you’ve been as far out on the rim as the asteroid mining
colony in the Altair system. It was a hole when you were here last and it
hasn’t improved with age. You’ve been in some dives in your time, but this
place takes the prize. Still, after a week squeezed into the cramped interior
of your ship, the Eclipse, even this hole will have to do. As you push through
a throng of particularly rough looking Proxians, their deep set yellow eyes
glare at you maliciously, their razor sharp claws flexing. Your hand rests on
the blaster hanging from your gun belt and they decide discretion is the better
part of valour. As you reach the bar, a slimy looking, thickset barman looks up
as you. Unlike some of the clientele, he isn’t literally slimy: He’s human,
just about. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Trent! As I live and breathe!”
The barman grins, a gold tooth glinting under the neon lights.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I was kinda hopin’ you weren’t.”
You reply sardonically. A pretty Vixian girl in a shimmering sequin dress
standing next to you at the bar stifles a chuckle. The barman’s smile falters
slightly, but he quickly recovers.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You’re a funny guy, Trent.” He
replies. “Always said that about you. Haven’t seen you on the Rock for a while.
What brings you back here?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">The Rock is the affectionate name
given to this mining colony, given that it is built into the side of the
largest asteroid in the Altair belt. The colony was briefly abandoned decades
ago when the bottom fell out of the Altairium ore market, but it was quickly
taken over by pirates, smugglers and other criminal organisations.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Work.” You reply. “That, and
this fine establishment.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Very kind of you to say.” The
barman smiles, your sarcasm lost on him. “Now what are you having?”</p>
