<p class="msonormal4" id="calibre_pb_6"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="Ale"></a>“Andromedan Ale.” You growl, tossing your credit crystal across
the bar.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Sure thing Trent.” The barman
grins, scanning the crystal and tossing it back to you. As he pours the frothy
green tinged ale, you glance around at the collection of reprobates, cutthroats
and thieves. You always feel strangely at home in this kind of company, which
makes you wonder just what that says about you. The barman slides the pint
glass across the bar and you lift it to your lips, taking a good, healthy swig.
Next to you at the bar, you notice the pretty Vixian girl’s eyes flick towards
you. You’ve never travelled to Vix IV, but you’ve always found the exotic
Vixian women strangely alluring with their pale blue skin, long, lustrous dark
purple hair and tall, slender figures. Apart from their colour, the Vix,
externally at least are humanoid, though they are spoken of reverently
throughout the galaxy for their sexual prowess. Though you’ve come here for
work, you are tempted to try your luck.</p>
