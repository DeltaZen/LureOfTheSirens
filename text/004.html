crystal across the bar.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Sure thing Trent.” The barman
grins, scanning the crystal and tossing it back to you. As he pours a glass of
the clear, blue spirit, you glance around at the collection of reprobates,
cutthroats and thieves. You always feel strangely at home in this kind of
company, which makes you wonder just what that says about you. The barman
slides the shot glass across the bar and you raise it to your lips. Next to you
at the bar, you notice the pretty Vixian girl’s eyes flick towards your drink.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You must be brave to drink
that.” She remarks, gazing pointedly at your Abyssynth. “I’d sooner drink
bleach.” </p>

<p class="msonormal5">You down the vile liquid,
immediately screwing your face up at the awful taste and the burning sensation
in the back of your throat as the liquid makes its way down your gullet. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’d imagine bleach tastes better
too.” You remark, pushing the empty glass away. The Vixian girl smiles at you.
You’ve never travelled to Vix IV, but you’ve always found the exotic Vixian
women strangely alluring with their pale blue skin, long, lustrous dark purple
hair and tall, slender figures. Apart from their colour, the Vix, externally at
least are humanoid, though they are spoken of reverently throughout the galaxy
for their sexual prowess. Though you’ve come here for work, you’re tempted to
pursue the conversation and try your luck.</p>
