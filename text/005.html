<p class="msonormal4" id="calibre_pb_10"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="Vixian_girl"></a>“Trent.” You grin, turning towards the pretty Vixian. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Elira.” She returns your smile,
her startlingly red eyes flicking in your direction. “You’re an Earthman aren’t
you?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Guilty as charged.” You admit.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’ve never had a problem with
Earthmen.” Elira replies. “I know many of the other older races find you young
upstarts an annoyance, but I’ve always been rather fond of you.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“On behalf of the Earth Alliance,
I thank you.” You reply with a little bow. Elira laughs, turning to you, giving
you her full attention. Her tight fitting sequin dress shimmers in the neon
lights of the bar and your eyes are drawn to the low cut neckline and a fine
pale blue cleavage.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What are you doing in this awful
place?” She asks, either oblivious or indifferent to your shameless gaze.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I was beginning to ask myself
the same thing.” You reply, tearing your eyes from her breasts. “Though if I
wasn’t here, I wouldn’t be fortunate enough to be chatting to such a beautiful
Vixian.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You’ve very kind.” She smiles,
her face flushing a slightly darker shade of blue. “I’ve never spent any time
with an Earthman. Perhaps I should have done if they’re all as charming as
you.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">She takes a sip from her drink, a
strange purple concoction, while her hypnotic red eyes study you for a moment.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“So Trent, you want to get out of
here?” She asks, raising an eyebrow.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="006.html#Leave_bar" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">Leave with Elira</a></p>

for information</a> </p>
