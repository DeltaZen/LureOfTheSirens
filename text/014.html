<p class="msonormal4" id="calibre_pb_28"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="Information"></a>“I’m after work.” You tell the barman. “You got any
leads?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Try speaking to Crassus.” The
Barman nods to a reptilian sitting in the corner. “He’s usually a good place to
start.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">You nod in thanks and walk across
the crowded bar towards him. His iguana-like head turns in your direction as
you approach the table. He is flanked on either side by henchmen of the same
race, though a little taller and more muscular than Crassus. They move to
stand, but Crassus ushers them to sit.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What can I do for you Trent?” He
asks, his voice deep and throaty.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’m looking for work.” You
reply, throwing yourself down in the seat opposite.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Then it’sss your lucky day.”
Crassus replies, his scaly lips curling into a smile, revealing rows of sharp
little teeth. “I have a lucrative job. Three dayssss’ work for ten thousand
creditssss. A shipment for delivery.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What’s the catch?” You reply.
“Illegal cargo?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“No, nothing like that.” Crassus
smiles. “Medical suppliessss. The delivery destination issss Omega station.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Omega station?” You reply,
remembering the far flung outpost. Like the Rock, Omega station was an
abandoned space station now occupied by smugglers, criminals and other
lowlifes. “That’s weeks away. You said three days.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“They have had a viral outbreak.”
Crassus explains. “A deadly strain of the Xevon virussss. They can’t wait
weeks. It’ssss three dayssss away travelling through the Dark nebula.” Crassus
grin spreads wider.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Dark nebula? Fuck that.” You
stand to leave. “Only one in three ships ever makes it through. You know that.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“That’s why it’ssss so
lucrative.” Crassus shrugs.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I need the money, but not that
much.” You begin to walk away.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Fifteen thousand creditssss.”
Crassus calls out, before adding, “On delivery.” You pause a beat, not turning
back.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Twenty thousand creditssss.” You
reply, mimicking him. “Half up front.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Seventeen thousand creditssss.”
Crassus tells you. “Five up front.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">You turn slowly around.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You’ve got yourself a
freighter.” You reluctantly reply.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">You cross the bustling docking
bay towards your ship. All around you, the dockhands scurry about, shouting and
swearing at each other as they go about their duties. The air is thick with the
smell of sweat, spilled coolant and asteroid dust. As you near your ship, the
deck plates shake underfoot as a freighter fires its thrusters before taxiing
and disappearing out into space. The air around it flickers as the vessel
pierces the thin force field keeping the vacuum of space from flooding the
docking bay. You reach your ship, the Eclipse. The chunky gunmetal grey vessel
would never win a beauty contest. The wide, box-like hold looking like an
afterthought compared with the angular cockpit and living quarters module
protruding from one end. The battered freighter is older than you are and
though it might look like it’s been stolen from a scrapyard (Which it has)
you’ve made some special modifications over the years, while retaining it’s run
down aesthetic. Good for business if you’re constantly underestimated. You
climb the boarding ramp and step aboard. With a hydraulic hiss, the door slides
shut behind you and you glance at your co-pilot, patiently waiting in the
cockpit.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’ve got us a job.” You smile
brightly. The voluptuous redhead glances over her shoulder from the co-pilot’s
seat.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Great.” She replies sourly. “So
much for R &amp; R.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Like you need it.” You reply.
“Though we’ve got enough time for a quick roll in the hay.” You add with a
smirk.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You really are an arsehole
Trent.” She fumes, climbing out of her seat to face you, her green eyes burning
with contempt. She wears a tight fitting silver catsuit and you feel your eyes
drawn to the zip, which is (No doubt deliberately) pulled down just low enough
to tantalisingly reveal a hint of her impressive cleavage. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I really should reprogram you
Vanessa.” You tell her. “Have you treat me with a bit of respect.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We both know you wouldn’t like
that.” Vanessa shoots back. “You like me with a bit of fire. Or perhaps you
would prefer me to be a little more demure…” Her long red hair begins to
retract into her hair follicles, the colour darkening as it shortens until she
wears a short brown bob. Her eyes alter to a hazel hue and her breasts shrink a
couple of cup sizes. Her confidence melts away and her eyes lower shyly.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Do you prefer me like this sir?”
She asks timidly.</p>
