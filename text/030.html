<p class="msonormal5">“Someone else will have to attend
to it.” You tell Vanessa. Her eyes narrow, but she remains silent. “We’ve got a
job to do and time is a factor.” </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I know.” Vanessa concedes with a
sigh. “It just feels a bit callous to ignore a distress signal.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I don’t like it either,” You
add, continuing to plot your course to the Dark Nebula, “But we’re already on a
mission of mercy here and this one we’ll be well paid for.” You lock in the
destination and press the hyperspace button. The hum of the engines build to a
crescendo before you hurtle into the spiralling red vortex of hyperspace as the
Eclipse is thrown across the galaxy over vast distances that would take years
to traverse in normal space.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Hyperspace engine two’s coil is
running hot.” Vanessa murmurs, studying the console in front of her. “Not a
problem at the moment, but we should really set down and have it repaired. If
it fails, we’ll drop back into normal space.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“How long to have it repaired.”
You groan. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“A day maybe?” Vanessa replies. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“A day we haven’t got.” You
wince.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We’ll lose longer than that if
we drop into normal space light-years from any civilised planets.” Vanessa
points out.</p>
