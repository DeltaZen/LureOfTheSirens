got time to set down for repairs. Keep an eye on it and hopefully our luck will
hold out.” Vanessa nods and you gaze out at the crimson hyperspace vortex,
feeling tense as your eyes continue to flick over to the flashing red warning
light on the console in front of Vanessa.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">Your journey continues without
incident for several hours, Vanessa studying the console intently for any sign
of the engine coil’s condition deteriorating. Then, just as you start to relax,
Vanessa speaks the words you have been dreading all day.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Hyperspace engine coil two
overheating.” She tells you. “Temperature now beyond design parameters and
increasing.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Shit!” You curse. “Shit, shit,
shit!”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Coil failing.” Vanessa
continues. “Dropping back into normal space.” She glances at you before
echoing, “Shit.” The hyperspace vortex fades away to be replaced by the inky
blackness and twinkling star field of normal space.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Where are we?” You murmur,
gazing at the navigation screen on the console before you. Before you can
establish your location, the whole ship shakes violently, nearly knocking you
from your seat. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Someone’s fired on us!” Vanessa
tells you, her eyes scanning the screen in front of her. “Looks like a pirate
marauder. Transmission incoming.” </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Prepare for boarding.” A voice
snarls through the speakers. “Comply and we’ll relieve you of your ship and
cargo. Resist and we’ll relieve you of your lives.”</p>
