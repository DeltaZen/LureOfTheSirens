<p class="msonormal4" id="calibre_pb_64"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="Attend_distress"></a>“Great.” You sigh, cancelling your course to the
Dark Nebula and plotting a new one to the source of the distress signal. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“It’s the right thing to do.”
Vanessa soothes. “And it’s only an hour away.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“An hour we don’t have.” You
snap, locking in the course and angrily thumping the hyperspace activation
button. The stars vanish from existence to be replaced by the swirling red
vortex of hyperspace.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Hyperspace again.” Vanessa
groans, throwing her feet up on the console and reaching for a dog-eared book.
You roll your eyes, recline back in your chair and close your eyes.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">The jolt as you drop out of
hyperspace wakes you from your sleep.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“There it is.” Vanessa murmurs,
putting her book down. The Spirit of the Stars is directly ahead but still a
distance away. Even at this range, you can tell you're too late. There is no
red glow from the engines, no running lights, nothing. It’s a lifeless hulk.
You both sit in silence for the next few minutes as you close in.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Any life signs?” You ask as you
reach the wreck, already knowing the answer as you gaze out at the damaged hull
shrouded in debris.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“None detected.” Vanessa replies.
“Still, you know what the sensors are like on this piece of shit.” You bristle
at her derogatory comment about your vessel, but you let it slide as truth be
told, she has a point. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“How many aboard?” You ask. She
punches up the ship’s records on the screen in front of her.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“One thousand, six hundred and
thirty seven souls.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Shit.” You murmur, reaching
forward and flicking a switch. Spotlights play across the hull of the vast
starliner. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“This doesn't look like an
accident.” Vanessa says quietly. “Look at the pattern of the damage. It's
consistent with hits from energy weapons.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Who'd attack the Spirit of the
Stars? It's just a starliner.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Pirates?” Vanessa suggests.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I've never heard of them hitting
anything this big.” You reply doubtfully. “Besides, where's the profit in
attacking a starliner? They're not in the business of snatching purses and
jewellery from overweight, middle-aged space tourists.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Whoever it was, I hope they're
not still about.” Vanessa replies, nervously studying the scanner. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Me too.” You reply grimly as the
spotlight slides across a huge rent in the side of the hull, with several decks
exposed to the vacuum of space.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Is it worth going aboard?”
Vanessa asks. “This looks like a lost cause and you said yourself, we don't
have the time.”</p>

may yet be survivors</a></p>
