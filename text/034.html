<p class="msonormal4" id="calibre_pb_68"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="Distress_Continue"></a>“We’ve come this far. We may as well be certain.”
You reply, bringing the ship into docking position alongside one of the
numerous airlocks. You press some buttons and the whole vessel vibrates as the
docking tube extends from the side until with a loud clank that echoes through
the ship, the docking tube makes a hard lock. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You want me to come with you?”
Vanessa asks.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“No, you’d better stay here just
in case whoever did this is still in the vicinity.” You reply, climbing out of
your seat. “I’ll suit up and go aboard myself.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Watch your back.” Vanessa
replies.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Sweetheart!” You grin. “I didn’t
know you cared!”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Get out of here!” She glares at
you, not quite disguising a smile playing at her lips.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">You stand in the docking tube,
examining the heavy steel airlock door. Without power, you’ll have to manually
open it. You pull open a panel and unsnap a winch lever from within. You push
it into a square hole and begin to wind the door open. As the door opens a
crack, there is a hiss as the air in the docking tube meets the vacuum on the
far side of the door. After a few minutes, you have wound the door far enough
open to squeeze through in your bulky spacesuit.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="Distress_restart"></a><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="Hyperspace_restart"></a>As soon as you step aboard, you wish you hadn’t.
You shine your torch down the darkened corridor and straight into the eyeless
corpse of one of the unfortunate crewmen. You stifle a scream of shock.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Everything ok over there?” You
hear Vanessa’s concerned voice over comms. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Oh everything’s just peachy.”
You deadpan, your heart thumping in your chest as you shove the corpse out of
your way, sending it floating across the corridor. You continue on, your
magnetic boots clanking on the deck plates.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“The bridge should be about two
hundred metres along the corridor.” Vanessa continues. “You’ll be able to check
from there if any of the vessel is still pressurised.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">A couple of minutes later, you
enter the bridge. Emergency power is in operation with the dim red emergency
lights lit while monitor screens eerily illuminate the corpses of the
unfortunate bridge crew as they float at their stations. You locate the damage
report station and check the screen, grimly confirming that the entire vessel
has been depressurised. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“This place is a tomb.” You tell
Vanessa. No answer. “Vanessa?” Still no answer. You notice one of the other
screens flashing red. You move closer, your eyes widening as you read
‘Proximity Alert’.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Vanessa, I don’t know if you can
hear me, but it looks like we have company. Might just be another ship
responding to the distress signal or it might be whoever is responsible. Warm
up the engines and the weapon systems. I’m on my way back.” As you leave the
bridge, you feel a vibration through the deck. Looks like the newcomer is
boarding. You curse yourself for not bringing your blaster and decide what to do.</p>
