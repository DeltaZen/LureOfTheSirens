overwhelm you as you desperately search for a hiding place. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Vanessa.” You hiss. “I’m going
to keep my head down until I know who’s boarding.” You suddenly realise that
the bridge is a dead end. The only way in or out is the corridor you have come
down. There is no obvious hiding place other than ducking down behind one of
the consoles, so you search for a makeshift weapon instead. After a couple of
minutes of fruitless searching, you hide behind the door and heft a fire
extinguisher cylinder, feeling vaguely ridiculous that it has come to this. You
peer around the corner and see two figures making their way down the corridor.
You know straight away that they are neither human nor any alien race you have
encountered before. They are tall and thin, their heads stooped under the
ceiling as they walk and they do not wear spacesuits. You have never heard of
any life form capable of surviving in the vacuum of space. As they reach the
bridge door, you swing the extinguisher cylinder with all your might into the
grey face of the nearest alien. His face explodes in a mass of purple blood,
globs floating off in all directions. You turn to his companion, but he has
reacted first, raising some sort of energy weapon. The blast burns straight
through your chest, a brief moment of agony before everything goes black and
you join the bridge crew as another floating corpse.</p>
