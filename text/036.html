towards the airlock.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“If you can hear me, I’m nearly
back to the airlock.” You tell Vanessa. You reach the half open door and begin
to squeeze through. You glance down the docking tube and realise with a start
that it isn’t your ship at the end of it. Instead, a vessel with a strange,
green shimmering hull is docked in the Eclipse’s place. Your eyes widen and you
hurriedly try to squeeze back through as a hatch slides open, bright light
spilling out into the docking tube. One of the air tubes on the back of your
spacesuit snags on something, tearing it from the back of your helmet. You fall
to the ground, gasping for air as it quickly drains from your suit. Just before
you black out, you see a strange figure silhouetted against the light looming
over you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">Your eyes flick open, your sleep
addled mind taking a moment to clear. As the synapses begin to fire, your eyes
widen as you remember your last conscious moments. You sit up, finding yourself
on a bed in a featureless room. No, not a room, a cell. You stand up, noticing
for the first time that your spacesuit is gone, replaced by a thin white tunic
and trousers. You look around, examining your new environment. You’re obviously
no longer aboard the Spirit of the Stars as the walls, ceiling and floor all seem
to be constructed from luminescent opaque white glass. There are two large
panels in the walls. You approach one and it slides silently open, revealing a
toilet and washbasin, also constructed from the same material as the walls. You
approach the second door, which remains closed. You smile grimly. This is
obviously the way out.</p>
