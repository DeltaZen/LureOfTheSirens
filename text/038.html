<p class="msonormal4" id="calibre_pb_76"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="Wait"></a>You return to your bed and sit down. You’re obviously being kept
here for a reason and your captors will no doubt reveal themselves and their
reasons for detaining you in due course.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">An hour later, having used the
facilities, you return to the main room to find a tray sitting on the bed with
two containers placed on it. One holds a browny-grey gloopy substance, while
the other holds water. Parched, you quickly drain the water before turning your
attention to the other container. You retch from the foul tasting porridge-like
food, but manage to keep it down. Despite your abhorrence, you are ravenously
hungry, so you steel yourself and continue to consume it.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">A few more hours pass and you
begin to hammer on the glass walls of the cell, yelling and screaming for your
captors to reveal themselves, demanding to know why they are holding you. There
is no response. Frustrated and angry, your hands throbbing from thumping the
walls, you collapse onto the bed and fall to sleep.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">Days pass and still your captors
do not reveal themselves. How long you have been confined is difficult to
gauge, but judging by the regular food deliveries and your own sleep patterns,
it has been a couple of weeks. You begin pacing up and down, the uncertainty of
how long you will be here threatening to drive you mad. As you pace, your mind
does somersaults, trying to remember all the people you have double-crossed,
stolen from or given cause to do you harm. Though the list is long,
incarcerating you does not fit the style of any of them. Most would favour
violent and bloody retribution. A sound behind you interrupts your thoughts and
you whirl around to see a figure stumble through the open door of your cell.
The door swiftly closes and the figure, a human woman, sees you and embraces
you, tears in her eyes.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Thank God!” She sobs into your
shoulder. “I thought I was here alone.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“It’s ok.” You soothe her. “We’re
going to be ok.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">After so long alone, your relief
is palpable.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Who are you?” You ask her.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“My name’s Alyssa.” She replies,
pulling back and drying her eyes on the back of the sleeve of the white gown
she is wearing. “I was a dancer on the Spirit of the Stars. I managed to get to
an escape pod during the attack, but next thing I know, I’m waking up in a cell
much like this one.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">You nod, noticing for the first
time how beautiful she is. Her long, blonde hair cascades down past her
shoulders, her eyes are pale blue and her full lips pout slightly. She is tall
and slender and she certainly has the lithe physique of a dancer.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’m Trent.” You reply, smiling.
“I’m the captain of a freighter. We answered your distress call. Up until a
moment ago, I was kinda wishing I hadn’t.” Alyssa laughs and her anxiety seems
to melt away.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Pleased to meet you Trent.” She
replies.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Any idea who’s holding us here?”
You ask her.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Have you tried pressing your
face up against the wall next to the locked door?” She asks.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’ve given that wall a wide
berth since I had a disagreement with the door.” You reply, massaging your
fingers at the memory.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Try it.” She says. You move
towards the wall and dress your face up against it. For a moment, you can see
nothing, then your eyes focus on a face. A long, grey skinned face with black
lidless eyes, like a shark’s eyes. Their hairless heads are smooth with gills
where their ears should be and a gaping maw for a mouth. The face stares
dispassionately back at you through the glass. You back away in disgust. You
know the vast majority of the known alien races but this one is not familiar to
you. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“There’s two or three of them
sometimes.” Alyssa continues. “I think they’re studying us. Maybe that’s why
they’ve put us in the same cell, to see how we interact.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We’re not animals!” You shout,
thumping the wall with your fist. “You have no right to treat us like this.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“It’s ok.” Alyssa tells you in a
soothing tone. “I’m just glad to have company after so many days with nothing
but their ugly faces for company.” You turn away from the wall, your fury
dissipating. She’s right, at least you’re no longer alone.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">You talk for hours, the words
spilling from your mouths in a torrent after so long without anyone to talk to.
You tell her of your humble beginnings on the Martian colony on Phobos,
enlisting in the Galactic Navy, your dishonourable discharge and your
subsequent career as an independent businessman. Alyssa smiles wryly as you
describe your current career, intuitively reading between the lines that your
business is not always strictly legal. Alyssa was herself born and raised on a
mining colony on Ganymede, but had dreamed of something better, finally getting
a place in a dance school back on Earth. She had graduated and applied for a
job on a starliner as a dancer.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“It was a dream come true.” She
smiles wistfully, sitting next to you on the bed. “I had always watched the
dancers on the vid broadcasts in our cramped quarters on the mining colony.
They always looked so beautiful, graceful and glamorous, so I was overjoyed
when I got a job on the Spirit of the Stars, travelling across the galaxy and
living the dream.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Right up until the part where
you got abducted by aliens eh?” You grin humourlessly.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Yes, that part wasn’t in my
vision.” She admits. “Still, it sounds like I’m the sole survivor, so I guess
I’m still pretty lucky.” She gazes at the floor, her eyes taking on a faraway
look, perhaps thinking of the friends she has lost.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Well, I guess I’m pretty lucky
too.” You grin, trying to brighten her spirits. “I may be locked in a cell, but
at least I’ve got a beautiful, charming woman for company.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">She looks up, stifling a chuckle
at your rather cumbersome compliment. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“That’s very kind of you.” She
grins. The luminescence of the walls suddenly dims, darkening the room.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Not very subtle are they?” You
say, glancing at the bed and suddenly feeling awkward. “You take the bed. I’ll
sleep on the floor.” She reaches out and gently squeezes your hand.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You know,” She smiles. “We don’t
know what they have planned for us. They might throw us out into space, dissect
us, experiment on us or any manner of horrible things. If this is to be our
last few days or hours, I’d rather be spending it doing something I’d enjoy
than sitting here waiting in fear.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What are you saying?” You reply,
already knowing the answer.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’m saying,” Alyssa replies, her
eyes smouldering, “We could always give them what they want…”</p>
