thrusting back against her shapely arse. She giggles and rolls over to face
you, her blue eyes gleaming in the darkness. You take her in your arms,
pressing your lips to hers. Your tongue darts between her lips, her tongue
meeting yours. A contented moan escapes her lips as your hands slide over each
other’s bodies, exploring and caressing. You reach under the hem of her gown,
your hand gliding over the soft flesh of her buttocks, while her hand slips
under your waistband. You groan into her mouth, feeling her lips curl into a grin
as she runs her fingers over your engorged shaft. You break the kiss and both
sit up, breathlessly stripping the clothes from each other, your eyes hungrily
devouring each other’s bodies as they are revealed in the dim light. Alyssa’s
gown discarded, she swings her long legs over the end of the bed and stands
before you, her eyes brimming with excitement and her lips pouting slightly as
she enjoys your gaze. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Beautiful.” You murmur, your
eyes drinking in her small, pert breasts, her brown nipples erect and begging
for attention. Your eyes slide further down her trim body, noticing the golden
curls of her pubic hair between her toned thighs. You stand, pressing your lips
back to hers for a moment before she begins to kiss down your body, her lips
sliding down your neck, kissing down your muscular chest and past your abdomen.
She drops to her knees before you, gazing thoughtfully at your erect cock
before reaching out and taking it back in her hand. She tightens her grip on
the upstroke and a bead of pre-come squeezes out from the tip. She leans
forward and her tongue darts out, collecting the drop of pearly white fluid and
tasting it, sitting back on her haunches and gazing up at you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Tastes better than that grey
crap they’ve been feeding us.” She grins. “You want to provide me with a bit
more?”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="054.html#Alyssa_BJ" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">Why not. The poor girl’s got to eat</a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="043.html#Alyssa_69" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">Sounds good, but you’d like to taste
Alyssa too</a></p>

on a scientific demonstration of coupling for your hosts</a></p>
