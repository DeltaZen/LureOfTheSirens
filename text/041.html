<p class="msonormal5">When you wake, you find that
Alyssa is no longer in bed. You call out for her, wondering if she is in the
bathroom. When she doesn’t answer, you climb out of bed, padding across the
floor. You then notice the pale green gas seeping into the room from the
ceiling. You cough, the noxious gas burning the back of your throat. Waves of
nausea wash over you and you stumble as you begin to lose control of your body,
dropping to your knees and slumping forward onto the floor. The nerve toxin
quickly does its work and as you feel yourself slip away, you realise that your
noncompliance has led you to be euthanized like a laboratory rat that has
served its purpose.</p>
