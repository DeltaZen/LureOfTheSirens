studies?” You quip, taking Alyssa in your arms. She grins before pressing her
lips to yours, kissing you passionately before breaking the kiss, her hands
pulling at your clothes, pulling your tunic over your head and dropping it to
the floor. Her hands tug at your trousers, pulling them down to your ankles. Your
hardening cock springs up, gently swaying before her.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“That will do nicely.” Alyssa
murmurs, running her fingers over your stiffening length. You slide your hands
inside her robe, pulling it open, a grin crossing your face as you gaze at her
small, pert breasts, her brown nipples erect and begging for attention. Your
eyes slide down her trim body, noticing the golden curls of her pubic hair
between her toned thighs. You press your lips back to hers and kiss for a
moment before she begins to kiss down your body, her lips sliding down your
neck, kissing down your muscular chest and past your abdomen. She drops to her
knees before you, gazing thoughtfully at your now erect cock as she continues
to stroke it. She tightens her grip on the upstroke and a bead of pre-come
squeezes out from the tip. She leans forward and her tongue darts out,
collecting the drop and tasting it, sitting back on her haunches and gazing up
at you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Tastes better than that grey
crap they’ve been feeding us.” She grins. “You want to provide me with a bit
more?”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="054.html#Alyssa_BJ" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">Why not. The poor girl’s got to eat</a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="043.html#Alyssa_69" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">Sounds good, but you’d like to taste
Alyssa too</a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="044.html#Alyssa_shagdoggie" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">You’re supposed to be putting
on a scientific demonstration of coupling for your hosts</a></p>
