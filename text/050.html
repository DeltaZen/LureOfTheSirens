to let this moment pass. You pull away from Alyssa, sending her sprawling
across the bed and charge at the alien, slamming your shoulder into his chest.
He lets out a deep wail of surprise as you knock him to the floor, the back of
his grotesque head smashing against the luminescent surface, knocking him
unconscious. You move through the open door into the wide corridor beyond,
where another startled alien is fumbling for a device on his belt. You don’t
know if it’s a weapon or a communicator, but he never gets a chance to use it
as you slam your fist into his gaping maw. He collapses to his knees and you
follow up with a knee to his face. He drops, groaning to the floor in front of
you. You stick your head back into the cell.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Quickly!” You shout at Alyssa,
who looks as stunned as the groggy alien at your feet. “Come on! This is our
chance!”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">She seems to be in a state of
shock, her eyes fixed on the unconscious alien in the cell.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Now!” You implore her. Still she
doesn’t move.</p>
