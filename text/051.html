her arm, dragging her from the cell. “I’m not leaving you here!” As you pass
the stricken alien outside the door, you kick him in the head for good measure
and stoop to pick up his weapon before hurrying down the corridor. You pass
through a door into another wider corridor, running past numerous cells,
constructed from the same material as your own, each with strange alien races
held inside. Three aliens emerge further down the corridor, hurriedly drawing
their weapons when they spot you. You open fire first, cutting them down.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Come on!” You pull at Alyssa,
who seems to be in a daze.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You don’t understand.” Alyssa
sobs as you drag her down the corridor.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I understand that if you don’t
want to end up back in one of these cells as an alien’s plaything, you’d better
hurry up!” You tell her brusquely. </p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">You reach the end of the corridor
where you are confronted by another door. As you search for the controls, it
begins to open. You quickly train your gun on the middle of the doorway as the
heavy doors slide apart. Your eyes widen in surprise as you find yourself face
to face with Vanessa, a smoking blaster in her hand. Behind her, a cavernous
docking bay is filled with strange alien vessels and the familiar shape of the
Eclipse. Alien corpses are strewn everywhere. Your surprised expression is
mirrored by her own, but she recovers quickly, her eyes flicking over your
naked form.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“A touch underdressed don’t you
think?” Vanessa comments wryly.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Never mind that.” You tell her.
“Let’s get out of here.” You cross the docking bay, stepping around the
corpses. “Where the hell have you been anyway?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’ve been chasing this ship for
two weeks!” She retorts. “It was only after they went into orbit around some
planet that I caught them up.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“So many dead.” Alyssa comments
sadly as you pass them. As you reach the Eclipse’s boarding ramp, Alyssa pulls
her hand from yours.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I can’t go with you.” She tells
you, tears in her eyes.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What are you talking about?” You
reply, turning to face her. “You can’t stay here.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You don’t understand.” She sobs.
“It’s… it’s just… I’m…”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“She’s one of them.” Vanessa says
calmly behind you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What are you talking about?” You
turn to Vanessa, noticing her blaster aimed at Alyssa.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“She’s one of the aliens.” She
replies. You feel like you’ve been punched in the gut as you turn back to
Alyssa, immediately seeing the truth in her tearful eyes.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“It’s true.” Alyssa sobs. “I’m
part of the research team. I’ve been surgically altered to resemble an
aesthetically pleasing human female.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“No.” You shake your head. “No
that can’t be true.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“So you fucked one of these ugly
bastards.” Vanessa shrugs. “You’ve had worse, now let’s kill the bitch and get
the hell out of here.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Please.” Alyssa begs. “I’m just
a scientist.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Her people killed everyone
aboard the Spirit of the Stars.” Vanessa reminds you. “She deserves to die.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“It was an accident.” Alyssa
cries. “We only meant to disable the engines and take some specimens. We must
have hit something volatile and it ripped the ship apart.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Oh, that’s fine then.” Vanessa
replies sarcastically. “Come on Trent, let’s put her out of our misery.”</p>
