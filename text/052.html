stricken alien, but looks at you blankly. You shake your head sadly and turn
away from the catatonic Alyssa before running down the broad corridor. You
reach a door at the end of the corridor and your hand pauses over the controls.
You glance over your shoulder as you feel a pang of guilt at abandoning her.
You pause, wracked with indecision before finally deciding that she’s had her chance.
As you turn back to the door, you notice movement from the prone form of the
alien. You have just enough time for your eyes to widen as you realise that he
has drawn his weapon before an energy blast sears through your chest. Your body
is thrown back against the door, slumping lifeless to the floor.</p>
