ignores you, his eyes fixed on Alyssa as he approaches the bed. You notice with
a start that his grey cock is erect. Alyssa turns her head to face him and you
watch with amazement as she smiles and reaches out for his cock, grasping it
and guiding it to her lips. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Alyssa?!” You stutter, your eyes
widening as her cheeks cave in with the suction as she pleasures the grotesque
alien. After a few moments, the alien throws back his head and lets out an
unearthly bellow. You watch with a mixture of fascination and disgust as thick
purple fluid shoots up the alien’s translucent grey shaft, erupting into
Alyssa’s mouth. She pulls back, holding the head just in front of her parted
lips as the thick, purple come streaks from the tip and into her waiting mouth.
She smiles up at him as the last weaker spurts splatter onto her lips and
trickle down her chin. The alien takes an unsteady step back, surveying the
sight before him. Alyssa smiles up at you both, her lips wet with alien seed
before opening her mouth and displaying a mouthful of purple semen pooled on
her tongue. Clearly enjoying your shocked expression, she closes her mouth and
swallows it before theatrically licking her lips.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Tasty.” She comments.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You’re disgusting.” You reply,
utterly repelled as you climb off the bed. “That’s vile.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Xenophobe.” She shrugs
shamelessly, collecting the errant droplets of purple come from her chin and
licking them from her fingertips. “Besides, you’ve just had interspecies sexual
relations.”<br class="calibre5"/>
“What do you mean?” You snap angrily, pulling on your clothes.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I mean, I’m not human.” Alyssa
smiles. “I’ve been surgically altered to appear human for the purposes of our
scientific research.” Your jaw drops as you digest her words, your blood
running cold.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Surgically altered from what?”
You ask, your mind reeling, already knowing the answer.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“From my people.” Alyssa gets to
her feet and gazes lovingly at the alien. “This is my mate, my… what would you
call it? Partner… husband.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You said you were a dancer on
the Spirit of the Stars,” You reply, feeling nauseous, “Raised on Ganymede…”
Your words trail away.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“A fiction I’m afraid.” Alyssa
smiles. “If it’s of any consolation, the experiment has been an unqualified
success.” She moves closer, reaching out a hand. You recoil in disgust. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What now?” You ask, slumping
against the cell wall, utterly defeated.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Unfortunately, your usefulness
is at an end.” She tells you, her smile fading. The alien walks through the
door and Alyssa follows him, pausing in the doorway before glancing over her
shoulder. “For what it’s worth, I genuinely enjoyed our time together. You were
an accomplished lover.” The door slides shut behind her and moments later a
noxious green gas begins to fill the room. You make no effort to delay the
inevitable, breathing in the foul smelling gas. As the nerve toxin begins to
overcome you, you slide to the floor, glad of the release of death.</p>
