<p class="msonormal4" id="calibre_pb_114"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="Alyssa_endgame"></a>At that moment, the door slides open and your eyes
widen in surprise as Vanessa appears in the doorway. For her own part,
Vanessa’s mouth drops open as her eyes flick from you to Alyssa and back.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I see you’ve been putting your
time to good use.” Vanessa quips, the muzzle of her blaster still smoking.
“Who’s your little friend?” She asks, looking Alyssa up and down.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Alyssa, Vanessa. Vanessa,
Alyssa.” You snap, quickly recovering your composure and pulling on your
clothes. “Now, if we’re finished with the formal introductions, it would just
be peachy if we could get the fuck out of here!”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">Alyssa quickly pulls her gown
back on and you take her hand, following Vanessa into the corridor beyond.
Alyssa gasps at the sight of two alien bodies lying on the floor outside. You
step over them and jog after Vanessa, passing through a door into another wider
corridor. You pass numerous cells, constructed from the same material as your
own, each with strange alien races held inside.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What is this place?” You murmur.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Who cares?” She replies
abruptly. “Let’s just get out of here. I’ve been chasing this ship for two
weeks. It was only after they went into orbit around some planet that I caught
them up.” You pass more alien bodies further down the corridor.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“So many dead.” Alyssa comments
sadly as you pass them.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“They didn’t seem too keen on me paying
you a visit.” Vanessa shrugs. “We’re nearly back to the Eclipse.” You emerge
into a large docking bay where yet more aliens lie dead. The Eclipse sits in
the middle of the vast chamber and you hurry towards it glancing over your
shoulder in case reinforcements are on their way. As you reach the boarding
ramp, Alyssa pulls her hand from yours.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I can’t go with you.” She tells
you, tears in her eyes.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What are you talking about?” You
reply, turning to face her. “You can’t stay here.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You don’t understand.” She sobs.
“It’s… it’s just… I’m…”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“She’s one of them.” Vanessa says
calmly behind you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What are you talking about?” You
turn to Vanessa, noticing her blaster aimed at Alyssa.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“She’s one of the aliens.” She
replies. You feel like you’ve been punched in the gut as you turn back to
Alyssa, immediately seeing the truth in her tearful eyes.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“It’s true.” Alyssa sobs. “I’m
part of the research team. I’ve been surgically altered to resemble an
aesthetically pleasing human female.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“No.” You shake your head. “No
that can’t be true.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“So you fucked one of these ugly
bastards.” Vanessa shrugs. “Let’s just kill the bitch and get the fuck out of
here.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Please.” Alyssa begs. “I’m just
a scientist.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Her people killed everyone
aboard the Spirit of the Stars.” Vanessa reminds you. “She deserves to die.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“It was an accident.” Alyssa
cries. “We only meant to disable the engines and take some specimens. We must
have hit something volatile and it ripped the ship apart.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Oh, that’s fine then.” Vanessa
replies sarcastically. “Come on Trent, let’s put her out of our misery.”</p>
