she pulls the trigger, shooting Alyssa in the chest. Alyssa crumples to the
floor, slumping face down before you. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Let’s get the fuck out of here.”
You say, gazing sadly at Alyssa’s corpse. “I want to forget any of this
happened.” Vanessa opens her mouth to say something, but seems to think better
of it.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“How about a drink?” She finally
suggests. “I know this nice bar on the third moon of Sirius Eight.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Sounds good.” You reply. “But
we’ve got a job to do first.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Still hell bent on taking us
through the Bermuda triangle of space then?” Vanessa mutters as you climb the
boarding ramp and make your way to the cockpit.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I didn’t think androids were
superstitious.” You reply as your fingers play over the controls in front of
you. Moments later, the engines hum to life and you manoeuvre the vessel out of
the alien docking bay.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Not superstitious.” Vanessa
retorts as you clear the alien vessel. “We do, however have an excellent mind
for numbers. The probabilities of successfully navigating the Dark Nebula
compared to the paltry reward do not fill me with confidence.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Come on Vanessa,” You flash her
a smile, “Where’s your sense of adventure?” Your excitement building, you are
already putting the distasteful business of your experience with Alyssa behind
you as you lean forward and press the hyperspace button. The hum of the engines
reaches a crescendo and the whole vessel lurches as you are thrown into the
endless swirling vortex of hyperspace.</p>
