<p class="msonormal4" id="calibre_pb_120"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="Alyssa_alienBJ2"></a>Desperate to reach your climax, you continue to
thrust into Alyssa as the alien crosses the room. You notice with a start that
the alien is naked, his engorged grey cock swaying with each step. Alyssa turns
her head to face him and you watch with stunned amazement when she smiles and
reaches out for his shaft, grasping it and guiding it to her lips. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Alyssa?!” You stutter, your eyes
widening as her cheeks cave in with the suction as she pleasures the hideous
alien. Her legs tighten around your thighs as she encourages you to continue to
pump your own cock into her. The alien lets out an unearthly grunt as Alyssa’s
lips slide up and down his grotesque phallus. On the very brink of your climax,
you somehow can’t look away, your grip tightening on Alyssa’s hips before with
a deep groan of release, you explode inside her. Your cock pulses again and
again, filling her clenching pussy with your seed. Alyssa’s groans, muffled by
the grey cock between her lips, join your own grunts as you shudder with each powerful
eruption. Your own needs sated, you pull back, your shaft slipping from
Alyssa’s glistening hole. Alyssa immediately climbs off the bed and drops to
her knees in front of the alien, taking him back into her mouth. You stagger
back a couple of steps, unable to tear your eyes away despite your revulsion as
her head bobs back and forth in front of the alien. The alien stiffens,
throwing back his head and lets out a strange bellow. Alyssa pulls him free of
her lips and gazes up at the alien, her pale blue eyes fixed on his soulless
black eyes. You watch with a mixture of fascination and disgust as purple fluid
races up the alien’s translucent grey shaft and erupts from the tip. Alyssa
giggles with delight as thick, purple come streaks from the tip to splatter
wetly across her face. The alien’s cock pulses again and again, coating the
pretty dancer’s features before she takes the tip back into her mouth and sucks
the last spurts from it. Spent, the alien pulls back, his cock slipping from
her mouth. She smiles up at you both, her face plastered with alien seed before
opening her mouth and displaying a mouthful of purple semen pooled on her
tongue. Clearly enjoying your shocked expression, she closes her mouth and
swallows it before theatrically licking her lips.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Tasty.” She comments.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You’re disgusting.” You reply.
“That’s vile.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Xenophobe.” She shrugs
shamelessly, purple come dribbling down her chin to splatter onto the tops of
her breasts. “Besides, you’ve just had interspecies sexual relations.”<br class="calibre5"/>
“What do you mean?” You snap angrily, pulling on your clothes.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I mean, I’m not human.” Alyssa
smiles. “I’ve been surgically altered to appear human for the purposes of our
scientific research.” Your jaw drops as you digest her words, your blood
running cold.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Surgically altered from what?”
You ask, your mind reeling, already knowing the answer.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“From my people.” Alyssa gets to
her feet and gazes lovingly at the alien. “This is my mate, my… what would you
call it? Partner… husband.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You said you were a dancer on the
Spirit of the Stars,” You reply, feeling nauseous, “Raised on Ganymede…” Your
words trail away.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“A fiction I’m afraid.” Alyssa
smiles. “If it’s of any consolation, the experiment has been an unqualified
success.” She moves closer, reaching out a hand. You recoil in disgust. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What now?” You ask, slumping
against the cell wall, utterly defeated.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Unfortunately your usefulness is
at an end.” She tells you, her smile fading. The alien walks through the door
and Alyssa follows him, pausing in the doorway before glancing over her
shoulder. “For what it’s worth, I genuinely enjoyed our time together. You were
an accomplished lover.” The door slides shut behind her and moments later a
noxious green gas begins to fill the room. You make no effort to delay the inevitable,
breathing in the foul smelling gas. As the nerve toxin begins to overcome you,
you slide to the floor, glad of the release of death.</p>
