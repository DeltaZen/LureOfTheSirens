tell the pursuing pirates, before leaning forward and cutting the engines.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You’re a wise man.” The pirate
tells you before ending the transmission. You can feel Vanessa’s eyes on you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“They’ve got a faster ship and
they outgun us.” You tell Vanessa, not able to meet her eyes.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“They’ll gut us, throw us out of
the nearest airlock and leave our corpses floating in space for all eternity.”
Vanessa replies. “If we’re lucky.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">You wait anxiously for several
minutes before a docking tube locks into place and the airlock opens. Three
pirates stride through, one with a jagged scar diagonally across his face,
another with a bionic leg, while the last, bringing up the rear carries an old
fashioned shotgun. The first two pirates part and the third levels the shotgun
at you, firing twice. You are both snatched off your feet, hitting the wall
behind you before slumping to the floor. As the life blood seeps from numerous
wounds across your chest, you glance to your side where Vanessa’s body
convulses grotesquely, electricity arcing across her own wounds.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“A droid,” The pirate comments
before glancing over at you, “And a coward.” You take your last shaking breath
and hear him add: “No great loss to the universe…” before everything goes
black.</p>
