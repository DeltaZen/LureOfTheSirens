<p class="msonormal5">“We’re standing by for boarding.”
You tell the pirates.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“No games.” The pirate growls.
“Or you’ll regret it.” You nervously wait and watch as the much larger vessel
closes in, casting a shadow over the cockpit. Vanessa waits patiently at the
weapons station.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Weapon systems locked on.” She
whispers.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Open fire.” You tell her. She
presses the button and the ship’s guns glow as plasma bolts strafe the
underside of the pirate vessel.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Direct hit!” Vanessa grins.
“Their main engines are disabled.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Quick, get us out of here.” You
tell her. Before you can react, the whole ship shakes with an explosion.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“They’ve returned fire.” Vanessa
reports, her voice deflated. “Our engines are offline.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Weapon systems?” You reply.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Non-operational.” She replies
before the ship vibrates as another burst of weapons fire strafes the back of
the ship.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Cargo hold is venting to
atmosphere.” Vanessa reports. You open a channel to the pirate vessel.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Hold fire, hold fire damn it!”
You shout.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Too late for that.” The pirate
growls before ending transmission. Another burst of weapons hits, this time
tearing the cockpit apart and you experience a quick though violent and painful
death in the frozen vacuum of space.</p>
