fingers playing over the controls as you prepare to jettison the fuel pod.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Fuel pod away.” Vanessa
confirms. “Weapons locking on.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Standby.” You tell her, watching
the pirate vessel on the scanner as it closes in, the fuel pod floating in
space between you and them. “Wait… wait… now!”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">Vanessa opens fire and you watch
the rear view screen with baited breath. The fuel pod explodes in a flash of
light and a maelstrom of debris and shrapnel, tearing into the front of the
pirate ship. Oxygen vents from the side of the vessel in a tall plume of vapour
and the ship begins to list to the starboard side.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“It’s worked!” Vanessa breathes a
sigh of relief. “Scanners indicate life support to the bridge has been
compromised. Engines are powering down. There are still life signs aboard,
perhaps trapped in the aft compartments. What do you want to do next?”</p>
