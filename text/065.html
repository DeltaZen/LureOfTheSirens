hoping we’re stupid enough to try and board.” You reply. “We’ll leave them to
rot.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">Vanessa pauses before finally
nodding in agreement.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Probably wise.” She says,
beginning to plot a course. You glance over at her, but she continues to work
the navigation controls. You can feel tension in the air and you’ve been flying
with Vanessa long enough to know when she’s biting her tongue.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Come on, out with it.” You sigh.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’m just thinking, it’s a pirate
ship.” Vanessa says.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“And?” You reply irritably. She
rolls her eyes.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“And pirate ships tend to have
holds full of valuables.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“With just a set of desperate,
blood thirsty cutthroats waiting for us.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I didn’t say it was without
risk.” Vanessa pouts. “It’s up to you… captain.” She adds with more than a hint
of insubordination. </p>

your journey</a></p>

ship and look for salvage</a></p>
