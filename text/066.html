lucrative job to do already. I haven’t survived this long by being greedy and
reckless.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“It’s a fair point.” Vanessa
reluctantly concedes.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Now, let’s see if we can patch
up the hyperspace coil and get back on our way.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">A couple of hours later, you
emerge from the Eclipse’s airlock. Vanessa is waiting and helps you out of your
spacesuit.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“All fixed?” She asks.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Dunno about that.” You shrug.
“I’ve done what I can.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“The Eclipse’s held together with
spit and prayers at the best of times.” Vanessa grins. “I’m sure she’ll get us
through the Dark nebula.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">A few minutes later and free of
the bulky spacesuit, you slide into your seat in the cockpit.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’ve laid in a course.” Vanessa
tells you. “Ready when you are.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“The moment of truth.” You
murmur, leaning forward and pressing the hyperspace button. You hold your
breath as the hyperspace engines spool up, the low whine building to a
crescendo.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Hold together sweetheart.” You
whisper to your ship. As if in answer, the stars fade away to be replaced by
the swirling crimson vortex of hyperspace as you hurtle towards your
destination. You sit back in your seat and breathe a deep sigh of relief.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Told you she’d be fine.” Vanessa
grins. “Now we just need to survive the Dark nebula.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“There’s that sunny disposition
again.” You reply, rolling your eyes.</p>
