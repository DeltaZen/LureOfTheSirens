what they’ve got in that hold.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">She nods and you loop back
towards the stricken pirate vessel, the plume of vapour petering out as the
last of the oxygen from the bridge dissipates into the vacuum of space. Vanessa
skilfully brings the Eclipse alongside, extending the docking tube until with a
metallic clank that echoes through the ship, the hard lock is made.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Ready for some piracy?” You
grin, getting to your feet. Vanessa rolls her eyes and follows you out of the
cockpit.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">You stand in the docking tube
between the two vessels, your hand at the airlock door release, knowing there’s
almost certainly a pirate waiting behind it.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Ready?” You ask Vanessa, who has
a pulse rifle slung over her shoulder and a blaster in her hand. You sometimes
feel a little ungallant, putting her in harm’s way, but with her computer mind
calculating every variable such as wind, air pressure and projectile velocity
she is an unerring shot. She nods, raising her blaster. You press the button
and as soon as the door slides open, you hear a bloodcurdling battle cry from
within which is immediately cut short by a single shot from Vanessa’s blaster. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Nice shot.” You tell her,
stepping over the dead pirate’s body and entering the vessel.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">Illuminated only by the strobing
red beams of the emergency lighting, the interior of the pirate vessel is
gloomy and full of constantly shifting shadows as you stalk down the corridor
towards the hold. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Main generators must have been
damaged.” Vanessa murmurs, sweeping her blaster to and fro, wary of any ambush.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“And I was thinking it was mood
lighting.” You reply sarcastically, your own blaster held out in front of you. </p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">You cautiously make your way
through the bowels of the ship, expecting an ambush at any moment, but as you
stand before the door to the hold, none has materialised. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Maybe they’re all dead.” Vanessa
suggests.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Maybe they’re all waiting behind
this door.” You reply.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Ever the optimist.” Vanessa
grunts, raising her blaster as you reach for the door control. You hesitate,
your finger hovering over the button. Vanessa glances at you questioningly.</p>
