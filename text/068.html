<p class="msonormal5">“What?!” She asks.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Sometimes discretion is the
better part of valour.” You mutter, turning and making your way back along the
corridor.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Sometimes you just need to grow
a pair!” Vanessa shouts from behind you. “What if Valerie Zeng had landed on
Mars and rather than put a footprint into that red soil, she’d thought the same
and launched back into space?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’ve made my decision.” You bark
irritably. “We don’t know what was behind that door.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Probably a hold full of riches.”
Vanessa mutters before falling silent as you trudge back to the Eclipse.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">You patch up the hyperspace coil
as best you can and a couple of hours later, you slip into your seat in the
cockpit. You can feel Vanessa glaring at you as you release the docking clamps,
retract the docking tube and continue your journey. You glance at the battered
pirate ship shrinking in the rear view screen and wonder what you have passed
up in abandoning your search? A violent death or riches beyond your wildest
dreams? You shrug, pushing it to the back of your mind as you contemplate the
journey ahead. You press the hyperspace button and hold your breath as the
hyperspace engines spool up, the low whine building to a crescendo before the
stars vanish to be replaced by the swirling crimson vortex of hyperspace. You
breathe a sigh of relief and even your morose co-pilot cracks a smile.</p>
