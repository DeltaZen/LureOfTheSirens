<p class="msonormal4" id="calibre_pb_138"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="Pirates_hold"></a>You nervously press the button and the door slides
open. It is gloomy inside and you both peer cautiously into the darkness but no
one seems to be lying in wait. You step inside the cavernous interior of the
hold, your feet clanking on a metal gantry high above it, but even under the
dim emergency lights, you can tell it is all but empty.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Well, what will we do with all
these riches?” Vanessa replies sarcastically.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Shit.” You exclaim bitterly,
kicking the railing in anger, the clanging sound echoing around the huge hold.
You grasp the railing and let out a deep sigh. “Well, we’re here now, so we
might as well check it out properly. Stay up here and cover me with the rifle
just in case any of our friends are hiding in the shadows down there.” Vanessa
nods and you clamber down a ladder, dropping onto the deck with an echoing
thud. Pulling your torch from your belt, you move across the hold, sweeping the
beam into the gloom, on edge in case any of the pirates are still lurking.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Anything?” Vanessa shouts down
at you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Just empty hold space.” You
reply, deflated. As you turn to leave, you notice a cargo container in the far
corner of the hold. “Just a second.” You move towards it and pull open the
door. It swings open and initially you think it is empty. Then you hear
movement at the far end, a figure moving in the shadows. You move cautiously towards
the figure, shining the torch with one hand while you train your blaster on
them with the other.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Get that light out of my eyes,
you dog.” The figure shouts defiantly. You pause, surprised by the well-spoken
feminine voice rather than the rough drawl of a common pirate. The woman is
perhaps in her early twenties with long, dark hair and pale skin. Her brown
eyes blink in the light of the torch, turning her head away. You realise that
her hands are tied behind her back and she is secured to the rear of the
container. You drop the torchlight out of her face. She is dressed in a long,
fine teal coloured dress, which though now grubby, is obviously expensive.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Found a captive.” You shout out
to Vanessa. “Looks and sounds rich. Might not be a wasted trip over here after
all.” You move towards her and pull her away from the wall, untying her bonds.
She gets gingerly to her feet, rubbing her wrists and eyeing you suspiciously.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Who are you?” She asks.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I could ask you the same thing.”
You reply.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I am Princess Elektra of Antares
Prime,” She tells you grandly. “And I demand you return me to my homeworld.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Do you?” You smirk. “Well,
pleased to meet you your royalness, and we’ll return you to your homeworld just
as soon as we agree an appropriate reward.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You mercenary vermin.” She
replies, her eyes blazing. “You’re as bad as these pirates.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Just making a living.” You
shrug, grasping her arm and leading her from the container.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Unhand me pirate!” She snaps,
twisting out of your grip and running from you. A single shot echoes in the
cavernous hold and a burn mark appears on the deck plate just in front of her.
She freezes on the spot, glancing up to the gantry where Vanessa looks through
the rifle sight at her.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“The next one goes through your
leg.” Vanessa shouts down. “We’d rather return you undamaged, but that’s up to
you.” At that moment an explosion rocks the ship.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We’re under attack!” You shout,
grabbing the princess. “Get back to the Eclipse.” Vanessa darts back through
the door just before a second explosion booms out followed by a loud creaking
from above. You drag the princess back just as the gantry collapses, the heavy
metalwork crashing down onto the deck before you. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Trent!” Vanessa shouts down from
the doorway above you. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Shit.” You murmur, looking at
the twisted wreckage before you and the doorway high above.</p>
