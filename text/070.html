idea.” You hurry back across the hold to the container and grab the length of
rope, running back across the hold as more explosions rumble about you. You
throw the rope up to Vanessa, who unravels it and dangles it over the side. The
rope is short, but just within reach. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You first.” You bark at the
princess. “Quickly!” You help her up and she grasps the rope. With a grunt of
effort, she tries to pull herself up, Vanessa easily anchoring the other end
with her mechanical strength above. Princess Elektra’s feet slip and slide on
the wall of the hold, but she simply doesn’t have the strength to pull herself
up. More explosions make the deck beneath your feet tremble.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We don’t have much time!”
Vanessa shouts. There is a deep rumble, following by a creaking sound and all
three of you look up at the source of the noise. The whole ceiling of the hold
rips apart, the air rapidly venting into the vacuum of space. You all scramble
for some kind of hand hold, but it is a futile effort. Princess Elektra, still
clinging to the rope which is now pulled taut towards the fissure above you,
screams as she loses her grip, her shriek of terror abruptly silenced as she
disappears into the freezing depths of space. Your hands grip tightly to the
wreckage of the gantry, but the ripped edges slice into your fingers. You lock
eyes with Vanessa, who is gripping the sides of the doorway, her green eyes
full of regret. Your bloodied fingers finally give way and you are sucked
through the air and out into the vacuum of space where you meet a quick but
unpleasant death, your body rapidly frozen solid before spinning into an engine
housing and shattering into thousands of pieces.</p>
