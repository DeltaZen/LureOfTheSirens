take whoever it is out.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What about you?” Comes the
anguished reply.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We’ll be ok, now go before it’s
too late. We’re sitting ducks down here.” Vanessa reluctantly nods and
disappears through the door. Another explosion shakes the ship, knocking both
you and the princess to the floor. A heavy supporting beam crashes down from
the ceiling, smashing through the deck plates just yards away.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We’re going to die aren’t we?”
Princess Elektra asks fearfully.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Not yet we’re not.” You reply,
spotting a circular hatch in the wall of the hold.  You grab the princess and
pull her back to her feet, more explosions echoing around the cargo hold as you
drag her across the deck towards the hatch. She screams in fright as a gantry
gives way, crashing down to the deck behind you. You wrench the hatch open and
unceremoniously throw her inside before climbing in and pulling the hatch shut
behind you. You turn, your eyes scanning the cramped cylindrical interior of
the escape pod. Six seats line each side while a pilot’s seat is placed in
front of controls mounted beneath a narrow window at the far end. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Sit down!” You shout at the
princess, who quickly climbs into one of the seats, her eyes wet with tears. A
large red button labelled “EMERGENCY LAUNCH” is placed in the centre of the
control console and you throw yourself at it, thumping it with your hand. There
is a deafening roar as boosters fire and the escape pod is hurled away from the
disintegrating pirate vessel. You glance through the small window in the hatch,
spotting another vessel starting another strafing run across the dorsal side of
the pirate ship. You have launched from the port side, so you cannot see if
Vanessa made it away in the Eclipse.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What’s happening?” Princess
Elektra wails.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Your guess is as good as mine.”
You mutter, turning back and studying the limited controls and instruments
before looking up and noticing a small white disc growing slowly but steadily
larger in the centre of the forward window. “Looks like we’re locked on to the
nearest planet. You’d better strap in. These things weren’t designed with
comfort in mind. It’ll be a rough landing.” She looks fearfully at you, tears
in her eyes, but does as she’s told.</p>
