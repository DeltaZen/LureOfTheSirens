in your seat to face her. She dries her tears with the back of her wrist and
straightens, regaining her composure. For the first time, you really look at
her. Though her hair is dishevelled, her face covered in grime and her dress
torn and grubby, she is a beautiful woman. Despite her sullen demeanour, she
has a pretty face and her brown eyes sparkle with life. She is slim, but with
curves in the right places, the low cut dress revealing a tantalising glimpse
of her cleavage while her hips are wide and her legs long and slender. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“This isn’t exactly the style of
travel to which I am accustomed.” She replies haughtily.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You should have spoken up
earlier.” You reply with mock disbelief. “The luxurious first class escape pod
was just next to this one.” She snorts derisively and petulantly folds her
arms. You roll your eyes and turn your attention back to the controls.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">You watch in silence for the next
hour as the planet grows nearer, gazing at the surface and wondering what it is
like. The white could be frozen wastes or perhaps the white sands of a desert
planet. Either way, it looks like you’ll have temperature extremes to contend
with. As the escape pod hits the edge of the atmosphere, it shakes and jerks
until you feel sure the pod is about to rattle itself to pieces. The princess cries
out with each jolt as you endure a turbulent descent. Soon enough, you break
through and fall towards the surface. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Ice.” You comment to the
princess as you gaze down at the featureless expanse below you. No, not
featureless. You spot a dark shape on the surface. As you plummet towards the
ground, you notice it appears to be square in shape. Too square to be a natural
phenomenon. It has to be a structure. Before you can examine it further, the
retro rockets fire, pulling the pod out of its headfirst dive and righting
itself before plunging into the ice. The landing is jarring and you are
violently shaken about before the escape pod settles down. You glance over your
shoulder at the princess, who looks traumatised by the whole experience.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You ok?” You ask her gently. She
takes a breath and nods meekly. You climb out of your seat and look out of the
window. Steam rises all around the crashed escape pod as the ice sizzles off
its hot shell, but you can just about make out a dark shape on the horizon. There
definitely seems to be some sort of structure out there.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> “Well, what do we do now?”
Princess Elektra asks, recovering from the shock of the landing and resuming
her frosty demeanour.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="092.html#Princess_leavepod" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">Go out into the freezing conditions
and make your way to the structure</a></p>

wait for rescue</a></p>
