emergency beacon transmitting. Someone should intercept it and respond.” She
nods, but looks less than convinced. “I’ll carry out a quick inventory and
check the pod over to see what kind of shape we’re in.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">You close the hatch behind you,
silencing the howling wind outside and rub your hands together, trying to work
some warmth back into them. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Damn cold out there.” You tell
the sullen princess. “The good news is that we have enough food and water to
keep us going for days, if not weeks.” She nods, brightening slightly.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“And the bad news?” She asks
meekly. The thought ‘Aside from being trapped in a confined space with a spoilt
bitch?’ flashes through your mind.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“The generator’s damaged beyond
repair.” You tell her. “No generator, no power. No power, no heating. We’ve got
emergency power, but that’s only enough to keep the instruments and beacon
going. It’s minus seventy out there and it’s only going to get colder when
night falls. The shell of this pod is well insulated, but it’s still going to
get pretty cold in here.” You reach into an overhead locker and rummage
through, pulling out a couple of thick blankets lined with silver foil. You
move towards Princess Elektra.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You stay where you are, pirate.”
She snaps at you, shrinking back.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Please yourself your Ladyship.”
You reply sarcastically, throwing the silver blanket across the cramped escape
pod to her. She stoops to pick it up before glaring at you from beneath a
fringe of dishevelled dark hair.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“And I thought it was frosty
outside.” You mutter, returning her icy glare and sitting down, pulling your
own blanket around you. You study the readings on the screen. It will be
getting dark soon and the temperature will be dropping further still.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">Across the escape pod, you can
hear Princess Elektra’s teeth chattering and glance over to where she is
sitting, hugging herself through the blanket and shivering.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Look Princess.” You tell her,
your breath visible. “While I think I’d sooner be stuck in here with the giant
flesh eating bats of Sirius 3…”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“The feeling, pirate, is mutual.”
She interrupts haughtily.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Shut up and listen, you spoilt
bitch.” You snap. Scolded and no doubt surprised and unaccustomed to being
spoken to in that manner, she falls silent. “It’s only going to get colder in
here. We need to do whatever is necessary to keep our core temperature up and
that means sharing our body heat.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">Her eyes widen.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’d sooner freeze to death.” She
replies, screwing her face up in disgust.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Suit yourself.” You growl,
turning away from her and wrapping the blanket tightly around yourself.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">A few hours pass and you sit in
silence, Princess Elektra sitting sullenly in the corner while you gaze out of
the window, watching for a light in the night sky. Soon, the window has frosted
over completely and you decide to try and get some sleep. You lie on the floor
and pull the blanket tightly around you, wondering as you begin to drift off,
whether you will ever wake.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">Your sleep is stirred by movement
close by. You open your eyes to see Princess Elektra, silhouetted in the
moonlight shining through the frosted windows as she sits down next to you. She
lies on her side before glancing over her shoulder, her glowering face just
visible in the dim light.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Well?” She says. “It was your
idea.” You lift your blanket and reach out, feeling her stiffen as you put an
arm around her and pull her towards you, her back against your chest, her
buttocks pressed against your thighs. You tug the blanket over you both and
after a moment you feel her relax. You lie there in the darkness, your face at
her neck and the faint aroma of her perfume in your nostrils. Your hand holds
the blanket over her, but you can feel the soft swell of a breast just beneath
the thin, silvery material. As the thought flashes through your mind, you feel
a tingling in your balls. No, you are not getting aroused by this stuck-up
bitch pressed against you, but the message clearly doesn’t reach your cock,
which begins to stiffen. You squirm slightly as your shaft hardens in the
restricted confines of your trousers. You are about to pull back slightly and
attempt to pull your throbbing member away from her when you feel her push her
hips back slightly. The movement is very subtle, almost imperceptible, but it was
there. You freeze, wondering if she was simply moving in her sleep, but then
she does it again, pushing back against you, a strangled moan escaping your
lips as her buttocks stimulate your aching erection. You lie there in the
darkness, your heart thumping in your chest, all thoughts of the cold and your
dire circumstances forgotten as you wonder what to do next.</p>
