<p class="msonormal4" id="calibre_pb_156"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="Princess_cometits"></a>You swing around and sit astride her, taking your
cock in your hand while Elektra pouts up at you, her eyes filled with a wild passion.
You gaze at the gentle curve of the tops of her breasts, still concealed within
the creased and crumbled dress. She smiles up at you as she guesses you
intentions.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You want to come on these?” She
purrs, pulling her dress down to her waist and revealing the soft, pale mounds
of flesh, the buds of her nipples hard and erect. Her eyes fixed on yours, she
presses her breasts together, accentuating her cleavage. “Come for me pirate.”
She murmurs thickly. “Come all over my breasts. Cover them in your warm, creamy
seed.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">You pump your cock harder and
with a roar of ecstasy, you feel your balls twitch and your come race up your
shaft. Elektra’s eyes widen as a powerful spurt of white fluid bursts from the
tip to land in her cleavage. She moans with delight as you grunt with each
powerful contraction in your balls as more come erupts from you, covering her
breasts as you sweep your cock one way and then the other until her chest is
splattered in your creamy white semen.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Look what you’ve done to me!”
She remarks in amazement as she gazes down at her defiled chest. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Not how I saw our evening
panning out.” You grin, enjoying the sight of her come splattered breasts.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Nor I.” She smiles shyly. You
reach down, using the corner of the blanket to carefully wipe your come from
her chest before she pulls her dress back up over her breasts and the tugs the
hem down over her thighs. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“It’s okay princess,” You smile,
“If we make it out of this alive, your secret is safe with me. No one needs to
know how you took advantage of me.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Why you impudent…” She begins,
aghast before her lips curl into a smile and she laughs. You laugh too, taking
her into your arms and pulling the blanket over the both of you before drifting
off to sleep.</p>
