pumping your cock rapidly now. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You’re getting close aren’t
you?” She teases, whispering in your ear. She rolls onto her side, her other
hand loosening your belt, freeing your cock from the confines of your trousers
before reaching inside and caressing your balls, her fingers sliding all over
your sack. The stimulation is too much and her pumping hand sends you over the
edge.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’m gonna come!” You grunt,
feeling your seed race up your shaft and gush from the tip, arcing through the
air to splatter on your chest. Princess Elektra gasps in surprise, before
tittering in delight as further spurts erupt from the tip, splashing across
your stomach. She giggles as the last weaker spurts dribble down her fingers.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“There’s so much!” She whispers
in awe, craning her head forward and gazing at the creamy globs of your come in
the moonlight. She examines the pearly fluid on her fingers before wiping it on
the corner of the blanket.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Well, that was… unexpected.” You
tell her.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“No one’s as surprised as me.” She
admits with a shrug, before pulling the blanket over her shoulders, perhaps
feeling the chill again. “I was lying there wondering if we’d freeze to death
in the night. Makes you want to spend your last few hours doing something that
makes you feel alive.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I couldn’t agree more.” You
grin, cleaning yourself up as best you can and drawing her to you, her head
resting on your chest. You soon both drift off to a satisfied sleep.</p>
