<p class="msonormal4" id="calibre_pb_178"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="Princess_Rescued"></a>You awake to a deafening roar of retro boosters
firing outside. You scramble to your feet, your eyes widening as a small, but
heavily armed military attack ship comes in to land alongside the escape pod.
Princess Elektra jumps up and presses her face to the window.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“It’s one of my father’s ships!”
She beams at you excitedly. “We’re saved!” She throws herself into your arms
and you embrace, relief washing through you. </p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">A few minutes later, you are both
standing in the hold of the rescue ship, wrapped in thick furs, presumably from
some unfortunate beast back on Antares Prime. A medic has checked you both out
and concluded that aside from mild hypothermia, you are both fine and should
make a full recovery. Amongst all the rescue personnel and fussing aides, you
recognise a face among the crowd.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Vanessa!” You smile.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Still alive then.” She deadpans.
“I thought I’d just inherited the Eclipse.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Sorry to disappoint you.” You
grin, before embracing her. “What happened?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“It was another pirate ship that
attacked us.” Vanessa replies, pulling away. “They’d obviously spotted our
little fracas on their long range scanners and thought to find some easy
pickings. They chased me across the system until her royalness’s daddy’s ship
intercepted us. They had been hunting the pirates, searching for their precious
princess. Once they found out that she wasn’t aboard, they blasted the pirates
to pieces. Nearly did the same to the Eclipse, but I managed to talk them down.
I took them back to the wreck of the first pirate ship. Once we found no sign
of you and an escape pod missing, it didn’t take long to track you down.
They’ve got a spare hyperspace coil, so they’re fitting that as we speak. Said
it’s the least they can do after our little ‘misunderstanding’.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I owe you one.” You reply
grudgingly.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“And I owe you one.” You hear a
voice whisper in your ear. You turn to find Princess Elektra standing right
next to you. She stretches up on her toes and kisses you tenderly on the lips.
“I shall never forget you.” She smiles, breaking the kiss. “Thank you for
rescuing me, for keeping me alive down here and…” She smiles shyly, “…and for
last night.” You spot Vanessa arching an eyebrow out of the corner of your eye.
“I shall see to it that my father rewards you handsomely.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">For a fleeting moment, you are
tempted to be the gallant space adventurer and waive the reward, but Vanessa
catches your eye with a look that quite clearly says ‘don’t even think about
it’.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="090.html#Princess_Reward" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">Take the reward</a></p>
