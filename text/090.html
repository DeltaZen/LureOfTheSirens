usher her away and you are left alone with Vanessa and her accusing eyes.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Thank you for last night?”
Vanessa repeats accusingly.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What can I say?” You shrug with
a sheepish grin. “We had to do what was necessary to survive on this ice cube.”
Vanessa shakes her head in disgust and doesn’t speak another word until you are
back in orbit aboard the Eclipse.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Time to get back on course.” You
tell Vanessa, studying the console before you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Yes, enough frolicking with
pretty princesses.” Vanessa replies acidly. “Let’s press on to this mysterious
death you have planned for us.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“That’s the spirit!” You grin,
punching the hyperspace button. The hum of the engines builds before the
Eclipse lurches as it leaves normal space and hurtles into the crimson vortex
of hyperspace.</p>
