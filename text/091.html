Princess Elektra. “Your tender kiss is ample reward.” Vanessa’s mouth drops
open and she rolls her eyes in disgust.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I really did misjudge you.”
Elektra smiles, kissing you again one last time before she is ushered away by
her people. You soon find yourself alone with Vanessa.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You’re a fucking idiot.” She
tells you with utter contempt. “Your cock really does do all you thinking
doesn’t it?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">You shrug and flash her a
sheepish grin. Vanessa shakes her head in disbelief and doesn’t speak another
word until you are back in orbit aboard the Eclipse.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Time to get back on course.” You
tell Vanessa, studying the console before you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Yes, enough frolicking with
pretty princesses.” Vanessa replies acidly. “Let’s press on to this mysterious
death you have planned for us.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“That’s the spirit!” You grin,
punching the hyperspace button. The hum of the engines builds before the
Eclipse lurches as it leaves normal space and hurtles into the crimson vortex
of hyperspace.</p>
