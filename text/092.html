Princess Elektra, pointing at the dark shape through the window. She joins you,
her breath misting up the glass. “Looks like it might be a structure of some
kind. I think we should try to reach it. I won’t lie to you. It will be hard
going, but it might be our only hope of survival if no one intercepts our
emergency beacon.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“It would appear we have little
choice.” She sighs deeply, her shoulders sagging.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">You reach up and rummage through
an overhead locker, pulling out two thick coats and a couple of blankets. You
throw the coat and blankets to the princess and pull on your own. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What are the blankets for?” She
asks, furrowing her brow.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Much as I enjoy a nice pair of
legs,” You reply with a cocky smile. “If you intend to keep them, we’d better
wrap them up.” </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You really are an impudent
rogue.” She glares at you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Why thank you.” You grin with a
half bow. She narrows her eyes at you, but you detect a hint of a smile at the
edges of her lips.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">A few minutes later, kitted out
with all you could salvage from the escape pod, you swing open the hatch and
step out into the desolate frozen landscape. The blizzard is howling all around
you, making visibility difficult through the snow flurries, but you can still
just about make out the dark shape in the distance. You suppress a smile at
Princess Elektra’s appearance, swallowed up inside the oversized thick coat
while her legs are bandaged with the blankets and ringed with tape to hold them
in place.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“If only the royal court could
see you now.” You grin. She glares back at you from beneath the furry fringe of
the hood. You turn and begin to trudge across the icy wastes.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">It is difficult terrain to
traverse and you make slow progress, hindered further by the petulant princess
who moans and whines at regular intervals. The dark shape on the horizon still
looks far off, but you estimate you are halfway. The sun is beginning to set,
an eerie golden twilight falling on the ice planet and the temperature dropping
still further. Your face feels frozen and the cold seems to have penetrated you
to your very bones. You pass through some rocky terrain and Elektra spots the
mouth of a cave in the face of an escarpment to one side.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Perhaps we should stop in that
cave overnight.” She suggests. “We can rest and set off again in the morning
when it’s warmer?” It doesn’t sound like the worst idea.</p>
