twilight soon turns to darkness and the temperature drops dramatically. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We should have stopped at the
cave.” Princess Elektra tells you bitterly, her face turning blue. You don’t
have the energy to argue and simply turn away, pressing on towards the
structure. </p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">Half an hour later, the structure
doesn’t seem to be any closer and you are walking into the wind, each step now
a monumental effort. You grimace, your face feeling numb and raw from the icy
gusts. You glance over your shoulder and realise to your horror that the
princess is no longer with you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">You quickly retrace your steps,
the wind now at your back, but your heart sinking with the thought that each
step backward is another you will have to repeat back into the biting cold of
the blizzard. You finally find a figure slumped face down in the snow. You roll
the princess over and know immediately it is too late for her. You lay her on
her back in the snow and mumble a few words over her frozen corpse before
getting unsteadily to your feet and turning back towards the distant structure.
</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">You continue on for perhaps an
hour before you drop to your knees, the last of your strength sapped. Unable to
take another step, you slump forward and grimly accept your fate, freezing to
death on this Godforsaken planet.</p>
