shelters you from the worst of the howling blizzard. It actually seems eerily
quiet, your footsteps echoing off the rocky walls.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I don’t like this.” Princess
Elektra tells you nervously.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“That’s a change.” You snap. You
can feel her eyes boring into you, but you ignore her, glancing up at the
darkening sky. It’s noticeably colder now and you begin to think you should have
taken your chances with the cave. You notice the moonlight glint off something
on the crest of the canyon side. You stop and squint, focusing on a figure.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What is it?” The princess asks. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Someone’s up there.” You tell
her. “And he ain’t alone.” Twenty or so figures have appeared along both sides
of the canyon. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Look!” Elektra points in front
of you at a lone figure walking slowly towards you, a blaster in hand. Your own
blaster is in your holster. The way you see it, you have three options:</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="096.html#Canyon_ShootALT" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">Fight. Try and shoot your way out
of the canyon</a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"> </p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="097.html#Canyon_runALT" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">Flight. Run back the way you came</a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"> </p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="120.html#Canyon_Wait" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">Wait and see who they are</a></p>
