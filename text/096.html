approaching figure, hitting them square in the chest. The figure collapses back
into the snow. The remaining figures surrounding you open fire. You are a
better shot than most and pick off three or four of them, their bodies toppling
into the canyon. A shot wings you, burning through the flesh of your left arm.
You grasp the wound and spin to take out the perpetrator, but ultimately there
are just too many of them. A shot hits you in the back and you are knocked from
your feet. You hear Princess Elektra cry out and run across to you as you try
to pick yourself up. She rolls you onto your back, tears in her eyes, but you
know it’s too late for you. Figures are already abseiling into the canyon and
approaching you. Elektra is roughly hauled away and one of the figures points
his blaster at your head, his finger tightening on the trigger. The last thing
you see is the flash of the muzzle.</p>
