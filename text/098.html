way off, so we’ll shelter in the cave until morning.” Relieved, she nods and
follows you into the mouth of the cave. You peer into the darkness, stalagmites
and stalactites protruding like the stone dagger-like teeth of some giant
monster’s maw. You sweep the beam of your torch from left to right, cautious in
case the cave is already occupied by some ravenous beast. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“It feels warmer in here.”
Princess Elektra comments as you make your way deeper inside.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We’re sheltered from the wind
chill.” You reply, but as you progress further into the depths, the air
definitely seems to grow warmer and you can hear what sounds like dripping
water ahead. The cave opens out into a large chamber, the torch beam reflecting
off a large pool, vapour rising from the watery surface.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“It’s a hot spring!” You grin,
setting down the torch and activating the lantern mode. The lantern illuminates
the cavernous chamber, the rocky ceiling covered in stalactites dripping icy
water into the pool creating circular ripples on the still surface.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Beautiful.” Princess Elektra
murmurs. You nod, before unfastening your thick coat and beginning to strip
off.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What are you doing?” She asks,
alarmed.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Don’t flatter yourself.” You
reply, stripping down to your underpants. “I’m going for a dip.” As you hook
your fingers into your waistband, her eyes widen and she hastily looks away.
You grin, pulling them off and dropping them with your other clothes before
stepping into the pool. You let out a contented sigh as your cold limbs are
quickly thawed by the warm spring water, wading out until the water is lapping
at your chest.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You should come in.” You call
out. “The water’s nice and warm.” She turns back to you, chewing her lower lip
thoughtfully for a moment before slowly pulling her coat off and unwrapping the
blankets from her legs. She kicks off her boots and reaches for the dress,
pausing and eyeing you suspiciously.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Turn away pirate.” She snaps,
though she doesn’t deliver her words with quite the vitriol of earlier. You
turn your back to her and a moment later you hear splashing water as she wades
out to join you. </p>
