her splashing as she wades out to join you. You flinch slightly when you feel
her lips brush against your ear.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Careful pirate,” She whispers,
“I might mistake you for a gentleman.” You smile, surprised by her playful,
almost flirty words and turn towards her. She beams up at you, immersed up to
her shoulders in the warm water. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Careful princess,” You reply,
throwing her a cocky grin. “With you looking that beautiful, I might forget I’m
not actually a pirate.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We wouldn’t want that would we?”
She purrs. Her brown eyes gaze up into yours and a subtle smile plays at the
edge of her lips as she moves closer, her face inches from yours. You lean
towards her, tentatively pressing your lips to hers. She kisses you back with a
passion and desire you would not have believed she possessed just a few minutes
earlier. You moan into her mouth as you feel her hand sliding down your abdomen
beneath the water. Her fingers glide over your stiffening shaft and she breaks
the kiss, a mischievous glint in her eye.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What should we do with this,
pirate?” She asks, tilting her head to one side. “You want me to stroke it?”</p>
