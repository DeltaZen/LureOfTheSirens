come in and settle down and try to slip past it.” She nods and you move to a
narrow alcove in the rocky wall, squeezing into the tight space. You switch off
the torch, plunging you into complete darkness. Elektra lets out a little
whimper and you can feel her trembling with terror against you. For your own
part, you can feel your pulse racing as the shuffling sound grows louder as the
creature approaches. Its heavy footsteps echo around the chamber and your hand
tightens on your blaster, knowing it is just a few paces away now. Its
footsteps stop and you hear a snuffling sound, as if it is sniffing the air.
More footsteps, approaching your alcove. It’s picked up your scent! You raise
your blaster, trying to sense where it is, but as your finger tightens on the
trigger, the creature roars and you feel an excruciating pain from your arm.
You scream out in agony, grasping it with your other hand, finding only a
bloody stump just below your elbow. Elektra’s screams of terror echo around the
cave as the unseen beast drags you out of the alcove. In the pitch black
darkness, you feel its hot, fetid breath on your face moments before jaws of
razor sharp teeth clamp down on your head, tearing it from your body.</p>
