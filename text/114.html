sounding more confident than you feel. “Here, hold the torch and I’ll shoot the
fucker.” She takes the torch and shines the beam towards the entrance of the
cave, the circular light wavering as she trembles in fear. Perhaps seeing the
light and realising that its cave is occupied, the footsteps grow quicker as
the shuffling beast draws near. You catch your first glimpse of the creature
through the stalactites and stalagmites, a huge, white furry beast walking on
six legs. It has small, black eyes and a wide jaw with dagger-like razor sharp
teeth spilling out of its terrible maw. It roars with rage as it spots you. You
open fire, blasting at it, burns appearing on its white fury hide. It keeps
coming and is nearly on you, howling in rage. </p>
