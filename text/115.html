terrible face. You manage to shoot it in the eye, but it keeps on coming. Its
jaws open wide and you scream in agony as it clamps down on your blaster arm,
its muscular neck twisting sharply as it tears it from your body. Princess
Elektra’s screams join your own as she watches on in horror. The beast knocks
you down, your blood spraying all over its white fur as it looms above you. A
talon-like claw crushes your chest, pinning you to the ground as it gazes at
you malevolently for a moment with its remaining eye before it leans forward
and shatters your skull between its powerful jaws. </p>
