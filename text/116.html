<p class="msonormal4" id="calibre_pb_232"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="Cave_slippast"></a>“We’ll use the lantern as a decoy and try and slip
past it.” You tell the princess, switching the torch back to lantern mode and
placing it on the floor at the back of the cavern. You hide in the shadows and
wait nervously as the creature’s heavy footsteps move closer. You watch as the
huge, white furred snow beast enters the cavernous chamber. It grunts as it
spots the unfamiliar light source and you watch its reflection in the still
waters of the cave pool, the beast supported on six powerful legs, its jaws
lined with rows of razor sharp teeth, glinting in the reflected light. As it
nears the lantern, you tug at Elektra’s arm and silently begin to make your way
out of the cave. Without the torch to guide you, you make slow progress,
feeling your way past the tall stalagmites stretching up all around you like
tree trunks in a forest. You can just about make out a faint light ahead when
you hear the lantern clatter across the cave floor. You hear the creature
sniffing the air, before roaring with rage. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“It’s picked up our scent!” You
hiss, pulling at the princess’s arm. You run towards the light, nearly tripping
over the rough, rocky cave floor as the light grows brighter. Behind you, you
can hear the beast howling in anger as it pursues you towards the cave
entrance. You can now see light at the mouth of the cave ahead and hurry
towards it, practically dragging the terrified princess behind you. You burst
out into the daylight, your feet crunching on the fresh powdery snow as you
run. Moments later, the beast emerges from the cave, its beady black eyes
finding you and bounding towards you on its six legs. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Keep going!” You shout, taking
pot shots at the creature over your shoulder, most of which miss the target.
The shots that do find their mark only seem to anger the beast as it chases
after you. You head towards a narrow canyon where the rocky floor will allow
you to move quicker, but the beast with its six powerful legs is gaining on you
as you both tire. You rattle off a few more shots, hitting it a couple more
times, slowing it, but though it roars with pain and rage, you don’t seem to
have damaged its resolve to tear you both apart. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I can’t go on.” The princess
gasps, slowing down. “Leave me. Save yourself.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“And lose out on that reward?”
You grunt, stopping and hitting the creature another couple of times. “We’ll
live or die together.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You old romantic.” She smiles
grimly as the beast bears down on you. Suddenly heavy blaster fire echoes in
the canyon, hitting the creature all over its huge torso. It stumbles forward,
dropping to its knees, letting out a final anguished howl before collapsing
face down into the snow. You look from the corpse of the snow beast to your
saviours. Twenty or so figures are silhouetted along the tops of both sides of
the canyon, their blasters now trained on you and the princess. A lone figure
walks slowly towards you along the canyon, a blaster in hand. The way you see
it, you have three options:</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="118.html#Canyon_Shoot" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">Fight. Try and shoot your way out of
the canyon</a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"> </p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="119.html#Canyon_Run" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">Flight. Run back the way you came</a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"> </p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="120.html#Canyon_Wait" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">Wait and see who your saviours are</a></p>
