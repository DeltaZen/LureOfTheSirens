<p class="msonormal4" id="calibre_pb_234"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="Cave_dodge"></a>Realising that you don’t have the firepower to defeat it,
you roll out of the way as it leaps towards you, the creature crashing into a
broad stalagmite behind you. With your attacker momentarily stunned, you grab
Princess Elektra’s arm and run towards the entrance of the cave. Behind you,
you can hear the beast howl in anger as it pursues you towards the cave
entrance. You can see light at the mouth of the cave ahead and hurry towards
it, practically dragging the terrified princess behind you. You burst out into
the daylight, your feet crunching on the fresh powdery snow as you run. Moments
later, the beast emerges from the cave, its remaining eye finding you and
bounding towards you on its six legs. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Keep going!” You shout, taking
pot shots at the creature over your shoulder, most of which miss the target.
You make towards a narrow canyon where the rocky floor will allow you to move
quicker, but the beast with its six powerful legs is gaining on you as you both
tire. You rattle off a few more shots, hitting it a couple more times, slowing
it, but though it roars with pain and rage, you don’t seem to have damaged its
resolve to tear you both apart. </p>

<p class="msonormal5"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="Canyon_restart"></a>“I
can’t go on.” The princess gasps, slowing down. “Leave me. Save yourself.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“And lose out on that reward?”
You grunt, stopping and hitting the creature another couple of times. “We’ll
live or die together.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You old romantic.” She smiles
grimly as the beast bears down on you. Suddenly heavy blaster fire echoes in
the canyon, hitting the creature all over its huge torso. It stumbles forward,
dropping to its knees, letting out a final anguished howl before collapsing
face down into the snow. You look from the corpse of the snow beast to your
saviours. Twenty or so figures are silhouetted along the tops of both sides of
the canyon, their blasters now trained on you and the princess. A lone figure
walks slowly towards you along the canyon, a blaster in hand. The way you see
it, you have three options:</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="118.html#Canyon_Shoot" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">Fight. Try and shoot your way out of
the canyon</a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"> </p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="119.html#Canyon_Run" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">Flight. Run back the way you came</a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"> </p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="120.html#Canyon_Wait" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">Wait and see who your saviours are</a></p>
