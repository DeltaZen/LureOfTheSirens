<p class="msonormal4" id="calibre_pb_240"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="Canyon_Wait"></a>You wait nervously as the strange figure approaches you.
The newcomer is wrapped from head to toe in thick and bulky snow garb. As the
figure reaches you, he gazes at you through snow goggles, his face hidden
behind a scarf wrapped around his head. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Trent!” A muffled, but clearly
feminine voice exclaims. “What are you doing in such an awful place?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I was askin’ myself the same
thing.” You grin, relaxing slightly, but still wary of the strange figure.
“We’ve obviously met, but you seem to have me at a disadvantage.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">She reaches up and pulls the
scarf down to her neck, a sleek, purple skinned face exposed, before pulling
the goggles up to her forehead, Princess Elektra stifling a gasp as her
startlingly red eyes are revealed. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Risa.” You smile, recognising
her immediately. “Damn, I haven’t seen you since…”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Since I was thrown out of the
academy.” She finishes, laughing. “Though I hear your career in the Galactic
Navy hit a similarly ignominious end too.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Well, you know how much I love
authority.” You reply.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Fuck ‘em, their loss.” Risa
shrugs. “Anyway, it’s far too cold to be standing around out here. Let’s get
inside so we can chew the fat and catch up on old times.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Sounds good.” You smile.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">Risa leads the way with Princess
Elektra and you following and her men falling in behind you. You reach the
structure you saw as you crash landed. The grey, squat, featureless structure
looms above you. It looks like it was once a military outpost, long since
abandoned. Risa and her people are obviously the new tenants, though you wonder
just what operation they are running here. The heavy blast doors slide open and
you all enter, the doors sliding shut behind you. Inner doors slide open and
you enter what might have once been a bar. The spacious living quarters are
furnished with couches and fur rugs. Risa and her people throw off their snow
garb and if you were in any doubt before, you are no longer. You glance at the
cutthroats and reprobates all around you and know you are the guests of
pirates. As Risa unwraps the scarf from her head, Elektra gasps. You suppress a
smile. The princess has obviously never encountered a Medusan in her sheltered
life. Risa’s head is covered in yellow tentacle-like hair that moves and
writhes as if it had a mind of its own. She wears skin tight leather trousers
which accentuates her fine buttocks while a tight pale blue vest top barely
contains her three shapely breasts.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“And you must be Princess
Elektra.” Risa smiles. “An honour to meet you, your majesty.” Risa curtseys
theatrically. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Please, could you contact my
father on Antares Prime?” Elektra asks. “I’m sure he will reward you.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Oh, he will reward us
handsomely.” Risa grins. “Eventually. Throw her Ladyship in a cell.” One of the
pirates roughly grabs the Princess, who squeals in protest.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“She’s mine.” You tell Risa. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“She was mine first.” Risa whirls
around on you, her red eyes flaring with anger. “I really should be quite
displeased with you for taking out one of my ships, so I wouldn’t push my luck
if I were you.”</p>
