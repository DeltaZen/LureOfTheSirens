defending myself. Release the girl or we are going to have a problem.” Your
hand goes to your blaster. Around you, twenty blasters are drawn. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You might have a problem.” Risa
smiles. “I won’t, apart from a corpse to dispose of. Either way, the princess is
mine.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You know how quick on the draw I
am.” You tell Risa. “If I die, you die with me.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“So be it.” Risa shrugs
nonchalantly, turning her back to you and wandering away. “But I’d much prefer
you to leave it.” She glances over her shoulder. “I’ve been cooped up with
these mindless thugs for months now. It would be nice to have a civilised
conversation with an old friend.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Give me the princess.” You
insist.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“No.” She replies. “The princess
is mine and that’s final.”</p>
