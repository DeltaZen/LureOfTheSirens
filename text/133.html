earlier altercation forgotten. As you reach for your glass, sipping your wine,
your mind returns to the fate of the princess.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“The princess…” You begin.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We’ve already discussed that.”
Risa replies tetchily.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I know, I know.” You reply,
throwing your hands up. “I’m not disputing your claim anymore. Listen, she’s a
spoilt little bitch, but I wouldn’t want to see any harm come to her.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“She’ll be well looked after.”
Risa replies sincerely. “My people might look a rough bunch, but they know
better than to do anything without my say so. You have my word that she’ll be
treated well.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Thank you.” You reply. Risa
meets your gaze and her piercing red eyes seem to bore into your very soul.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Why Trent, you’re not developing
a conscience?” She smiles. “How very dull.” She claps her hands and the pirates
begin to file back into the room. One approaches Risa and whispers in her ear.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“One of my other ships has been
chasing yours halfway across the system.” She tells you. “They’ve been called
off and your sex robot’s requesting permission to land.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">You bristle at the casual insult,
but let it slide. Risa reaches up, stroking your face. “I was serious about us
going into partnership. I could do with someone with your skills.” Her eyes
flick to your groin and you realise she’s not just taking about your piloting.
“What do you say?”</p>
