<p class="msonormal5">“I knew you were too smart to
pass up a good thing.” Risa grins. She holds out her hand and one of the
pirates passes her a communicator. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Eclipse. Permission to land
denied.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What?” Comes Vanessa’s response,
slightly distorted over the communicator. Risa passes you the communicator.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’m staying here.” You tell
Vanessa. “The Eclipse’s all yours.” You pause before adding, “All the best
Vanessa.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What are you taking about?”
Comes the angry response. “What the fuck? Are you fucking insane? I….” Risa
presses a button ending the transmission.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“She’ll get over it.” She
replies, casually throwing the communicator over her shoulder. She turns
towards you, her breasts thrust forward provocatively. “Now, I think it’s time
for a celebration of our partnership.” Some of the pirates are already heading
for the door when she follows up with a loud, “Out!”</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">You never hear from Vanessa
again. Whether she continued the job and became yet another lost ship, the
latest victim of the Dark Nebula, you never know. She might have simply never
forgiven you for cutting her loose. Either way, you never give her much thought,
too busy building up a vast criminal empire with Risa while enjoying vigorous
pleasures of the flesh with the insatiable Medusan. It couldn’t last of course.
A decade later, your organisation had grown too large and drawn the attention
of the Galactic Navy. Tasked with putting a stop to it, a heavy cruiser dropped
out of hyperspace in orbit and bombarded your base with its huge plasma
cannons. Neither Risa nor you knew a thing about it, Risa aptly riding you to a
climax moments before you were both utterly obliterated. </p>
