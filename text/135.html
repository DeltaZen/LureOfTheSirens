have to decline.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Oh?” Risa replies, masking her
disappointment well, but a slight sagging of the shoulders gives her away. “No
matter. Your loss.” She adds nonchalantly, turning away.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Risa.” You put a hand on her
shoulder, but she shrugs it off before spinning around and glaring angrily at
you. “Let’s not part like this. We were good together and I’d love to wake up
every day with you beside me, feel your body pressed to mine. But my place is
among the stars, travelling from one run down spaceport to another, pirates and
the authorities chasing me from one system to the next.” Her expression softens
and a subtle smile crosses her lips.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Perhaps you’re right.” She
replies, stretching out a hand. “Then we’ll part as friends.” You shake her
hand and she leans in to you, her lips at your ear. “And remember, if you’re
ever passing…”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Wild snow beasts couldn’t keep
me away.” You tell her, flashing her a cocky grin before turning and leaving.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">A couple of hours later, you
watch the haze of the outer atmosphere fade away to be replaced by the deep
black of space punctured by pin pricks of distant stars as the Eclipse leaves
Risa and her frozen world behind. Risa’s people had managed to jury rig a
replacement hyperspace coil and you smile, once again on your way.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“So what about the princess?”
Vanessa asks. Your smile falters a little as you feel a sharp pang of guilt at
abandoning Elektra.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Risa will negotiate her return.”
You tell her.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Really?” Vanessa scoffs. “You
mean hold them to ransom.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Something like that.” You shrug.
“Not our problem anymore.” You add, trying to disguise your guilt with
nonchalant bravado.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Heading?” Vanessa asks, perhaps
detecting your discomfort and changing the subject.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You know our heading.” You
reply. “Plot a course for the Dark Nebula and take us into hyperspace.”</p>
