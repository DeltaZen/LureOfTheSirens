Vanessa grumbles, swinging her legs up onto the console in front of her and
pulling out a dog-eared book. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Reading one of your crappy
antiques?” You suggest. “Why bother when you could absorb it in a moment and
save yourself the time?” Her obsession with reading books has always puzzled
you. Every time you dock, Vanessa always makes a point of checking the local
traders for old Earth books. With her computer mind, she could absorb the
complete works of Shakespeare in a split second. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“They weren’t written to be
absorbed.” Vanessa replies tetchily. “They were written to be read word by
word, sentence by sentence, so that’s what I’m doing.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Ok, ok!” You reply. “Still, I
can think of better ways of filling our time.” You add with a raised eyebrow.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You know as well as I that we
need to keep an eye on the instruments.” Vanessa chastises you. “If we lose our
bearings in hyperspace, we’ll never find our way out again.”</p>
