no reason.” You reply, before grinning at her. “Besides, you know me. I like to
be in and out with a minimum of fuss.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You old romantic.” Vanessa
replies sarcastically, before rolling her eyes and putting down her book. “Will
a blowjob shut you up?” She glares at you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“It might.” You grin. She lets
out a sigh and drops to her knees in front of you, pulling your fly open and
roughly pulling out your flaccid cock. She takes you in her hand and begins to
slowly stroke you, your cock growing erect from the attention. As you let out a
groan of pleasure, she smiles sexily up at you, perhaps warming to the idea.
She drops her head into your lap and you moan with delight as you feel the
delicious warmth of her mouth enveloping the tip of your cock. She begins to
bob her head up and down, your shaft glistening with her saliva as she
pleasures you. Her pumping hand in unison with her sucking lips soon has you on
the brink and with a final loud groan, you reach out, gripping the console as
you explode into her mouth. As your hips buck in your seat, Vanessa dutifully
sucks the erupting come from you, gulping down each volley as it gushes into
her mouth. As Vanessa swallows the last weaker spurts, she pulls back, licking
your cock clean before glancing up at you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Happy now?” She asks grumpily,
getting up and sliding back into her seat.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Ecstatic.” You grin before
glancing through the cockpit window. Your smile vanishes as you realise you
have left the hyperspace corridor, the vortex no longer visible, just a field
of pulsating red blurs.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“No!” You shout. “No, no, no!”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Oh my God!” Vanessa exclaims.
You glance at the console and realise guiltily that when you gripped it as you
came, you accidently guided the ship off course.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Quick, drop us out of
hyperspace.” You tell her, trying to make sense of the readings being thrown up
on the screens in front of you. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“But we could end up anywhere.”
She objects.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Do it.” You shout. “At least
we’ll be back in normal space.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">Her fingers fly over the console
and the whole ship jerks as you drop out of hyperspace. Sirens immediately
start to go off and the ship creaks horribly. You glance out of the cockpit
window, your eyes widening when you realise you are gazing into the pitch black
abyss of a black hole.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You fucking idiot.” Vanessa
bitterly curses you just before the ship is ripped to pieces and you die a
brief, but violent and painful death in the vacuum of space before your corpse
is drawn into the mouth of the black hole and compressed to an infinitesimal
particle.</p>
