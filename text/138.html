<p class="msonormal4" id="calibre_pb_276"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="Hyperspace_cautious"></a>You let out a sigh of disappointment and settle
down into your seat, gazing at the monotonous swirling infinity of hyperspace.
You glance over at Vanessa, her eyes scanning the pages of her book. You drink
in her voluptuous body, her long red hair cascading past her shoulders, her
beautiful green eyes and her full lips. She senses your eyes on her and she
glances over at you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What?” She snaps, eying you
suspiciously. “I got something on my face?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Just admiring my beautiful
co-pilot.” You grin.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Still not going to happen.” She
says dismissively, turning back to her book.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“That’s not what I mean.” You
tell her with a hint of indignation. “I’m not completely shallow and sex
obsessed. I just think we’ve got a good thing going on. Though…”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Though?” She glances sideways at
you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Though sometimes I wonder how
much is real and how much is your programming.” You muse. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You can be a fucking girl at
times.” She chastises you. “We’ve been through this before. My artificial
intelligence works the same way as the human brain. We both start off with just
the basics, but you learn through experience. We are both the sum of our
memories. You have grown to feel affectionate towards me, while I… I don’t
despise you as much as I used to.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Stop it Vanessa, I’m getting
choked up.” You reply, with a lopsided grin. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Likewise arsehole.” She replies,
flashing you a grin. “Honestly, if I could cry, I may even shed a tear when you
die in the Dark nebula.” </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You’re such a pessimist. We’ll
be fine.” You recline back in your chair and close your eyes, soon drifting off
to sleep.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">You jerk awake, a deafening
klaxon abruptly disturbing a rather pleasant dream involving you and three
beautiful, scantily clad girls from Epsilon IV. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What the fuck?!” You curse
groggily.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We’ve entered the Dark nebula.”
Vanessa replies, studying the screen in front of her. “We’re hitting some
strong hyperspace turbulence. It’s unusually high. Must be something to do with
the nebula. We can either drop out of hyperspace or try and ride it out. Drop out
of hyperspace in the middle of the nebula and we might meet the same fate as
those countless missing ships, though if the turbulence gets any worse, it
might tear us apart.”</p>
