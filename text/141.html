to drop us out of hyperspace. We’ll take our chances in the nebula.” You lean
forward in your seat and jab the hyperspace button, the crimson haze fading as
the Eclipse drops back into normal space. You both gasp at the sight that
awaits you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Wow!” Vanessa exclaims,
mirroring your own thoughts. All around you are hundreds, if not thousands of
derelict space ships, from vessels half the size of the Eclipse to vast naval
carriers and bulk cruisers. While many appear to have originated from Earth,
there are also a number of strange vessels from alien worlds.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Some of these ships have been
here a long time.” You comment, your gaze drawn to a large blue coloured vessel
as the spotlights play over the battered derelict, the name “Cosmic” just about
visible. You recognise the name as one of the higher profile vessels to have
been lost in the nebula. “The Cosmic went missing over a hundred years ago.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What’s happened to them all?”
Vanessa whispers, leaning forward in her seat, gazing out at the stricken
vessels.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“They all look pretty lifeless.”
You murmur. “No running lights, no engine glow, nothing.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’m picking up life signs.”
Vanessa tells you, the light from the screen illuminating her features. “A
large vessel dead ahead. Shall I lay in a course?”</p>
