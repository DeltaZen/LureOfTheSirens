sigh. “Lay in a course and we’ll see if we can get some answers.” Vanessa nods
and fires the thrusters, weaving through wreckage and past the battered remains
of vast cruisers and transports. You clear a gargantuan mining vessel and
behind it you can see the running lights of your destination, shining like a
beacon in the night. The latticework superstructure of the midsection
stretching three hundred metres long with the huge nuclear engines at one end
and the command and habitation section at the other.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“That’s the Magellan.” You
breathe, recognising her immediately. “She’s the most famous vessel to have
disappeared into the Dark Nebula.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I know the story.” Vanessa
replies, gazing in awe. “The flagship of the early deep space exploration
vessels when Earth first discovered hyperspace.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“That was nearly two hundred
years ago.” You add. “She was the first vessel known to have disappeared in the
nebula.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I wonder who’s on board.”
Vanessa muses. “Shall I try to hail them?”</p>
