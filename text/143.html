of here before we end up just another lifeless wreck with a couple of corpses
inside. Well, one corpse and an android with an exhausted power source. Reverse
course and get us out of here.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">Vanessa nods and manoeuvres the
ship around, firing the thrusters and heading back the way you came. You thread
your way through numerous vast hulks and spinning debris, but keeping your
course true. </p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“There seems to be no end to this
debris field.” You murmur after half an hour, gazing through the cockpit
window, hoping that the density of wrecks will begin to thin. “How many ships
are out there?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Too many.” Vanessa replies. “I
wonder what prevented them from leaving.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“That looks familiar.” You
comment as a large blue vessel catches your eye. “Must be a sister ship for The
Cosmic. Looks near enough identical.” As you pass the battered hull, the
spotlights play over the side, picking out the name.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“It can’t be!” Vanessa says
incredulously.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What the fuck?!” You exclaim.
“We’re back where we started!”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">Vanessa studies the screen in
front of her.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Spatial co-ordinates confirm we
are.” She tells you. “But we were on a linear course. We should be far from
here.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We need to get out of this
fucked up nebula.” You reply, dread clawing at you as you begin to fear it is
already too late.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We could try again,” Vanessa
suggests, “Or we could head towards those life signs and see if they have any
answers?”</p>
