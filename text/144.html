fires the thrusters, flying through the wreckage of countless vessels, debris
zipping past you, skeletal struts and antenna arrays tumbling across your path.
Vanessa studies the display in front of her, ensuring you don’t deviate from
your linear course.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">Again after half an hour of
travelling, you notice a distinctive blue hull ahead.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“The Cosmic.” You groan. “I’m
starting to get a feeling of déjà vu.” </p>

<p class="msonormal5"> Vanessa glances at the
navigation screen.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“According to our spatial
co-ordinates, we’re back where we started again.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I wonder how many of these
wrecks met their end just like this?” You wonder aloud. “Burning through their
fuel and oxygen without actually getting anywhere.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“It’s like space here is
spherical and we’re trapped inside.” Vanessa suggests. “I think whichever
direction we head in, we’d always come back to where we started.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Any suggestions?” You ask her.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We can persevere, but the
definition of insanity is to repeat the same course of action and expect a
different result.” Vanessa shrugs. “I’m still reading life signs on board a
large vessel dead ahead. What do you want to do?”</p>
