introduce ourselves in person.” Vanessa nods and fires the manoeuvring
thrusters, the Eclipse floating closer to the lights of the ancient vessel. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Just look at her.” Vanessa
whispers in wonder. “They don’t make them like that anymore.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“She’s a museum piece all right.”
You nod as you manoeuvre closer, running parallel with the framework of the
midsection and heading towards the habitation section. You gaze in awe at the
famous old vessel, slowly making your way past the huge transparent dome on the
dorsal side which housed the hydroponics chamber before the sleek conical nose
tapers to the bridge at the very tip.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“There’s a docking port on the
starboard side on B deck according to the original blueprints.” Vanessa tells
you, scanning the screen in front of her. “I’ll aim for that.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">As you draw alongside the airlock
to the habitation section, Vanessa slows the Eclipse down, the yellow and black
striped airlock door contrasting with the smooth white hull of the Magellan.
You come to a full stop and there is a whining sound as Vanessa extends the
docking tube. It locks onto the side of the Magellan with a clank that echoes
through the ship.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Hard lock in place.” Vanessa
confirms. “Readings confirm that the Magellan is pressurised and the air is
breathable.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Let’s go meet our mysterious new
friends.” You tell Vanessa, getting to your feet.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">A few minutes later, you stand in
the docking tube, Vanessa just behind you. You raise your hand to open the
airlock before pausing and drawing your blaster.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Hardly sending out the right
message.” Vanessa observes.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Perhaps, but you know me,” You
glance over your shoulder and flash her a grin, “I’m always a cautious man.”
You press the button and the heavy airlock door slides open. You step inside,
the door sliding shut behind you. There is a hiss as the airlock cycles before
the inner airlock door opens and you step into the Magellan. You sweep your
blaster up and down the corridor, but no one is waiting for you. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We should split up.” You tell
Vanessa. “We can sweep the ship quicker that way.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Really?” She replies. “You want
to explore this creepy derelict on your own? I’ve seen this movie before and it
doesn’t end well.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You’re a big girl.” You reply
sharply. “I’m sure you’ll be fine.” Vanessa glares at you, but reluctantly nods
her agreement before studying a map on the wall.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Left to the bridge, right to the
crew quarters.” Vanessa tells you. “Which way are you going?”</p>
