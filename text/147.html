Vanessa. “You investigate the bridge.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Just to clarify,” Vanessa asks,
“When you’re horribly dismembered by some nightmarish creature skulking in the
air ducts, the Eclipse is mine?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Relax!” You tell her. “It will
be fine.” She snorts derisively and stomps off towards the bridge.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">Your footsteps echo as you walk
slowly along the narrow corridor, exposed service pipes and conduit running
along the walls, giving the ship an old fashioned, functional feel. The air
smells stale and there is a thick layer of dust on everything, adding to the
archaic, museum piece aesthetic of the ancient, pioneering Earth vessel. You
glance behind you, noticing the tread patterns of your boots in the dusty
footprints trailing you. Life signs or not, no one else has walked down this
corridor in a long, long time. A burst of static from your communicator makes
you jump.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Just reached the bridge.”
Vanessa tells you. “Nothing to report. Quiet as a morgue in here.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Nice analogy.” You grumble
before noticing a door a few paces ahead. “I’m nearly to the living quarters.
I’ll let you know what I find. Trent out.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">You jab your finger on the door
open button and the door slides open, the ancient mechanism creaking in
protest. The room beyond is in darkness. You step inside and automatic lights
flicker on in quick succession. A wave of nausea sweeps over you and you
squeeze your eyes shut. After a moment, it passes and you open your eyes,
taking in your surroundings. It seems to be a crew lounge, with several
comfortable looking chairs and couches laid out around the room. Unlike the
corridor outside, the room is immaculate and completely dust free. A row of
cryo-tubes line one wall, all empty with the exception of one. The cryo-tube is
misted up, but you can see the unmistakable outline of a figure within. You
move closer, examining the display mounted on the front of the cryo-tube. Life
signs are stable and the occupant is in a perfect state of suspended animation.
For a moment you think you hear Vanessa calling you on the communicator, but
when you glance at it, it is still in standby mode. You turn your attention
back to the cryo-tube, a green activation button blinking invitingly.</p>
