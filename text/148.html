<p class="msonormal5">“Been nice knowing you.” She
replies acidly before trudging off towards the crew quarters. You smile to
yourself and turn left along the corridor towards the bridge. </p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">Your footsteps echo as you walk
slowly along the narrow corridor, exposed service pipes and conduit running
along the walls, giving the ship an old fashioned, functional feel. The air
smells stale and there is a thick layer of dust on everything, adding to the
archaic, museum piece aesthetic of the ancient, pioneering Earth vessel. You
glance behind you, noticing the tread patterns of your boots in the dusty
footprints trailing you. Life signs or not, no one else has walked down this
corridor in a long, long time. You notice the door to the bridge just ahead.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">The bridge door creaks open, the
mechanism labouring. You wrinkle your nose as an unpleasant smell hits you
before stepping inside. The bridge is deserted, banks of screens and control
stations laid out before you, all covered in a thick layer of dust. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Just reached the bridge.” You
tell Vanessa over the communicator. “Apart from a foul stench, there’s nothing
to report.” </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Sounds like your boot locker.”
Vanessa replies. “I’m nearly to the living quarters. I’ll let you know what I
find. Out.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">You notice a soft glow beneath
the layers of dust on the consoles. The screens are all still operational and
you move to one, sweeping your hand across it, wiping the dust from it. You
study the antiquated systems read-out. You should be able to retrieve the
captain’s log from here.</p>
