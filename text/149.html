until you find the captain’s log. You jab your finger at it and the log screen
opens. A video thumbnail appearing for each one. You sit down in the dusty
chair and bring up the first one. Captain Meyer, a stout, balding man beams at
the screen, enthusiastically speaking of his honour at commanding such a
historic mission, his pride at serving on such a fine vessel with a capable
crew and his excitement at what they might discover in the unknown of deep
space. You skip through a few routine log entries as the captain describes new
star systems, planets and comets they have discovered. You are about to close
another mundane entry when the captain makes mention of a nebula:</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Our mission specialist, Doctor
Maria Walsh is fascinated by a new nebula and has requested a closer look. I
have agreed that it warrants further investigation and we should reach it in
just under three weeks.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">You find an entry three weeks
later, in which Captain Meyer, shoulders hunched, his normally breezy delivery
replaced by an anxious, tense tone:</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We have entered the nebula.
Sensor readings within the nebula are nonsensical and we seem to be drawn back
to the same coordinates no matter which heading and speed we set. Of further
concern is some anomalous behaviour from our star drive. The engineers are
investigating and we hope to be underway soon.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">You select the next log entry a
couple of days later, a weary looking Captain Meyer provides an update:</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We remain stranded within the
nebula. Our engineers are at a loss to explain the problems with the star drive
which are occurring more and more frequently. Several crew members are behaving
strangely with wild bouts of violence. Understandably, morale is very low and
the whole crew is on edge. Hope to have better news soon.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">You notice there are just two
more log entries remaining. The next, three days after the last shows the
captain, eyes bloodshot, his face unshaven and looking increasingly distracted:</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“The situation is spiralling out
of control. The star drive is off line. The generator is still operational, but
the power is not reaching the engines. We have lost contact with the engineers.
We sent a team to investigate, but they have disappeared too. The crew seem to
be descending into hysteria and no one is willing to check the engine room. I
would go myself, but I fear for the consequences to the ship and my crew if I
were to disappear too.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">You click on the final entry.
Captain Meyer faces the camera, his teary eyes wide and wild:</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’m the only one left. I have
failed. I have utterly failed. I have failed my crew and I have failed myself.
I won’t go like the others, willingly into the abyss. I will remain master of
my own destiny.” Your eyes widen as the captain raises a pistol to his head and
pulls the trigger, the gunshot ringing out while the screen is splashed with
blood.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Shit.” You curse, turning from
the screen and reaching for your communicator. “Vanessa.” No response.
“Vanessa?” Still nothing.</p>
