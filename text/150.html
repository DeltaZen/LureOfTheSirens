of the smell. It seems strongest to the back of the room and you make your way
towards a storage locker. You grimace with foreboding as you reach out,
grasping the handle of the locker door and pulling it open. You turn away, your
eyes watering at the stench, clamping a hand over your nose and mouth. The
corpse has been there for some time, but you would estimate years rather than
decades. As you bring yourself to examine the skeleton, the skin shrunken
around the bones, you notice the uniform of the Galactic Navy and the badge of
the Triton on his sleeve. You vaguely remember stories about the Triton, a big
warship, disappearing a few years earlier. Your initial impression is that the
man had been murdered and the corpse stuffed in the locker, but there doesn’t
seem to be any obvious trauma and from the way the body is positioned within
the locker, it looks like he climbed in himself and stayed there until he died.
You begin to regret your decision to split up with Vanessa. What horror had
driven this man to conceal himself and waste away rather than face it?</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Vanessa.” You speak into your
communicator. No answer. “Vanessa?” Still no response.”</p>
