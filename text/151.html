and run down the narrow corridor, your feet kicking up clouds of dust in your
wake. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Vanessa?” You call out again
into the communicator. Still no answer. You pass the airlock to the Eclipse and
follow Vanessa’s footprints in the dust towards the crew quarters. You reach
the far end of the corridor and punch the door open control. The door opens and
you step into the darkness inside, fumbling for your torch. A wave of nausea
passes over you and you squeeze your eyes shut, grasping the frame of the door
before it passes. As you open your eyes, the automatic lights slowly flicker to
life, illuminating the room. It seems to be a crew lounge, with several
comfortable looking chairs and couches laid out around the room. Unlike the
rest of the vessel, the room is immaculate and completely dust free. Though
Vanessa is not here, you are not alone. A row of cryo-tubes line one wall, all
empty with the exception of one. The cryo-tube is misted up, but you can see
the unmistakable outline of a figure within. You move closer, examining the
display mounted on the front of the cryo-tube. Life signs are stable and the
occupant is in a perfect state of suspended animation.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Vanessa.” You speak into the
communicator. “I don’t know if you can hear me, but I’ve found an occupied
cryo-tube.” Still no answer. You stand before the cryo-tube, the green
activation button blinking invitingly.</p>
