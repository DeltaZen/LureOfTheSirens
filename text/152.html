cautiously stalk further into the vessel, walking down a long corridor. The
door at the far side of the room slides open before you and your jaw drops as
you survey the sight before you. The vast chamber is three storeys high and is
a mass of vegetation. The huge transparent dome overhead confirms that it had
once been the Magellan’s hydroponics chamber, but after two hundred years of
neglect, the plant life has run riot. You step inside, the floor, thick with
undergrowth feels boggy underfoot. Exotic trees and shrubs grow everywhere and
you look about in wonder as you make your way through the dense vegetation. You
duck under branches and gaze up at the leafy canopy, the starlight visible
through the transparent dome. After just a few paces inside, you wipe beads of
sweat from your forehead, feeling as though you have left the Magellan behind
and entered a humid rainforest under a starry night sky.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">As you progress deeper into the
rainforest, you hear what sounds like a whimper ahead. Your grip tightens on
your blaster as you approach the source, hearing it again. You burst into a
clearing and for the second time in the space of a few minutes, your jaw drops.
A naked dark haired man is lying on his back on the lush grassy ground while an
equally naked woman with long blonde hair sits astride him bouncing up and down
in his lap. She is perhaps in her late twenties while he looks four or five
years older. They are both athletically built and you find your eyes drawn to
her small but pert breasts and her erect nipples jutting proudly out. Her eyes
are closed and a blissful smile spreads across her face. Another whimper
escapes her lips, before she arches her back, throws back her head and cries
out in ecstasy as she reaches her climax. Her body shudders and jerks for a
moment before she straightens, panting for breath. Her eyes flick open,
widening in surprise when she sees you lurking at the edge of the clearing.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We have a guest.” She murmurs to
her partner. The dark haired man glances in your direction.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Welcome.” He grins, completely
unabashed. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You won’t need that.” The blonde
smiles, her eyes flicking towards the blaster in your hand.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“She prefers a different sort of
weapon.” He quips, making her giggle.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Who are you?” You ask,
holstering your blaster.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’m Adam.” He tells you. “She’s
Eve.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Really?” You reply doubtfully.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I guess that makes you the snake.”
Eve giggles, glancing at your groin. “Why don’t you lose the clothes and join
us?” She suggests, raising an eyebrow.</p>
