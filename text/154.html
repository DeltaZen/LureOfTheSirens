back to the corridor leading to the Eclipse. The door slides open and Vanessa
is standing just behind it.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“There you are.” You grumble.
“Where the hell have you been?” She opens her mouth to respond, but you hold up
your hand. “I doesn’t matter. We’re getting off this fucking ship. I can’t put
my finger on it, but something’s off here.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Getting superstitious?” She
grins as you retrace your steps towards the airlock.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You can sneer all you like,” You
reply, “But my gut feeling has got me through some tight scrapes in the past
and I’ve learned not to ignore it. I wouldn’t expect someone like you to
understand.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Someone like me?” She spits.
Wincing, you pause a beat, glancing at her and finding her glaring back at you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I didn’t mean anything by that.”
You reply carefully, trying to diffuse the situation. “You have many advantages
over a real human, but even those geniuses at Hyperion Cybernetics can’t
program instinct.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Well, it was still a shitty
thing to say.” She pouts, hitting the button to open the airlock.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">You climb into your seats in the
cockpit and immediately retract the docking tube, manoeuvring away from the
ancient vessel.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Another vessel appearing on
scanner!” Vanessa tells you. “It looks like it’s been hiding on the blindside
of the Magellan.” You gaze through the cockpit window as a strange alien vessel
emerges from behind the Magellan, the seamless, formless hull seeming to
shimmer and shift as it is revealed. Though dwarfed by the ancient Earth ship,
it is much larger than the Eclipse and begins to manoeuvre towards you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Hyperspace engines are back on
line.” Vanessa adds, gazing at the console in front of her. “What do you want
to do?”</p>
