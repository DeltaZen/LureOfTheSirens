ride Adam.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Does it matter?” She replies flippantly
before rolling her eyes. “Very well. We were part of the crew of a salvage
vessel. We’d heard the stories of all the ships that had gone missing in the
Dark nebula and our late captain decided it was a potential fortune worth the
risk if we could find some of the wrecks.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We found them alright,” Adam
snorts derisively, “And quickly became one ourselves.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“The captain, obsessed with
escaping the nebula, put the engines well over the red line.” Eve continues,
grinding her hips in Adams lap. “We just made it to an escape pod before the
whole ship exploded.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“The Magellan was the only vessel
with power, so we made our way here.” Adam adds, clearly bored with the
conversation. “That was three years ago.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What’s happened in between?” You
ask. “Have you been able to make any progress with escaping the nebula?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We haven’t even tried.” Adam
replies, reaching up to cup Eve’s pert breasts. “Eve was a communications
officer and I was the ship’s cook. We’re hardly qualified.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What have you been doing all
this time?” You ask.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What else is there to do? We’ve
fucked and fucked and fucked.” Eve grins shamelessly. “Though, much as I’ve
enjoyed Adam’s company, I’m ready for some fresh meat.” Her gaze again drops to
your groin. “So how about it new guy?”</p>
