teeth and continue to thrust deeply into Eve’s arse.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Yes! Yes!” Eve screams, her body
stiffening before with a satisfied cry of pure pleasure, she bucks and trembles
in ecstasy. Her sphincter clamps tightly around your shaft, milking you and
quickly sending you over the edge. You slide your hands down to her hips and
grip her tightly as you thrust up inside her snug passage one last time, your
cock spurting powerfully into her bowels.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“That feels so good!” She moans.
“I can feel your hot creamy come inside me!” With each pulse of your cock, you
can feel yourself growing weaker and weaker, as if your energy is being drawn
from you with every spurt. You feel yourself losing consciousness, pulling your
spent cock from Eve’s arsehole and slumping back into the soft undergrowth of
the rain forest. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I don’t feel too good.” You
groan weakly.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Don’t trouble yourself.” Adam
tells you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Yes, you’ve served your
purpose.” Eve grins, getting to her feet and gazing down at you. You look
quizzically up at her, confusion etched on your face. Your vision fades and for
a moment, you find yourself lying in a different room. A vast chamber covered
in blood red tendrils. You can feel them wrapped around you, restricting your
movements, sucking the life from you. You don’t even have the energy to
struggle, slipping back into unconsciousness from which there is no escape.</p>
