failing as the beautiful blonde reaches you. She smiles and drops to her knees
in front of you, gazing at your hard cock gently swaying before her.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I want you to come in my mouth.”
She tells you, her eyes flicking up and fixing on yours. “I want to taste your
creamy seed.” You nod dumbly, as she reaches out and grasps your shaft, guiding
it to her lips. You groan in pleasure as she takes you back into the warm,
moist confines of her mouth. Eve’s head begins to rock back and forth, her lips
sliding up and down your length, quickly finding her earlier rhythm as her hand
strokes your shaft. You reach down, running your fingers through her hair as
her head bobs at your groin. Her other hand reaches between your legs, her
fingers gently caressing your tightening balls as she senses your climax
swiftly approaching.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“That feels so good.” You pant.
“You’re going to make me… ahhhhh!” Your hips jerk and your cock twitches as a
torrent of semen races up your shaft and into Eve’s waiting mouth. You groan in
ecstasy as your cock pulses again and again, filling her mouth, a trickle of
pearly white come trickling out of the corner of her mouth. As your climax
subsides, Eve rocks back, grinning up at you with a mouthful of your seed. Her
eyes meet yours and she gulps it down.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Mmmm, tasty.” She purrs. You
take a step backwards before your legs give out from under you and you fall
backwards into the soft undergrowth of the rainforest. You try to get back up,
but all your strength has gone and you can only lie there, utterly helpless.
Eve gets to her feet and stands over you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“A pity you couldn’t last
longer.” She murmurs sadly. “It might be a while until I can eat again.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">Your vision blurs and Eve seems
to melt away. Just for a fleeting moment before your body begins to shutdown
entirely, you see red tendrils everywhere. You try to move, but you can feel
them wrapped around you, drawing the last of your life force from you before
you fade into oblivion, your husk-like corpse joining the thousands of others
consumed over the last two hundred years by the organism infesting the
Magellan.</p>
