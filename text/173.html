green button on the front of the cryo-tube before stepping back and drawing
your blaster. Light blue digits on the cryo-tube display glow, counting down
from ten as you shift your weight from one foot to the other as you nervously
wait. The countdown reaches zero and with a whirr of servo motors and a hiss of
equalising pressure, the door opens, sliding towards you before hinging to one
side. Vapour pours from the open cryo-tube and you squint, blaster aimed at the
occupant. With a groan, a figure lurches out towards you. Your finger tightens
on the trigger before your eyes widen and you drop the weapon, reaching out to
catch the occupant as she staggers towards you. It is a young human woman,
dressed in just a thin camisole and panties. Her body and hair are soaked with
traces of cryogenic coolant, your hands sliding against her moist skin. You
take her in your arms to stop her falling and she gazes up at you, confused and
fearful.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Who are you?” She rasps.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“My name’s Trent.” You tell her.
“You’ve been in cryogenic suspended animation.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Yes… yes…” She replies vaguely.
“I remember now.” Her eyes widen in fear as her memory comes flooding back. “I
was the last one!” She adds, her voice trembling. “The rest of the crew had
disappeared, the captain had killed himself! The ship was dead in space. I put
myself into cryo-sleep and hoped someone would rescue me. How long has it
been?” </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Let’s not worry about…” You
begin gently.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Tell me!” She insists earnestly.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Nearly two hundred years.” You
wince.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Two hundred years!” She echoes
incredulously, gazing through you as she digests the full weight of your
statement. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What’s your name?” You ask her,
trying to take her mind off the shocking news. She seems to have regained her
balance and strength and you let go of her. She takes a step backwards and you
take her in. She’s a pretty, petite brunette, perhaps in her late twenties
(Relatively speaking at least!) with a slight build and small perky breasts.
You can’t help but notice her hard nipples and dark areola clearly visible
through the flimsy, damp material of her camisole. Her soaking wet brown hair
hangs down past her shoulders.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Marie.” She replies, chewing her
lower lip thoughtfully. “Marie Walsh. I’m… I was the Magellan’s astronomer.” </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Nice to meet you Marie.” You
smile. Her beautiful chestnut brown eyes meet yours and just for a moment, you
detect a connection between you. Her lips curl into a shy smile and you feel
helplessly drawn by her alluring gaze.</p>
