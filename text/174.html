gaze away from her hypnotic brown eyes. “You should probably change before you
catch your death.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Yes.” She smiles shyly. “I guess
that would be ironic after two hundred years in a freezer.” You rummage through
some lockers and find a remarkably fresh looking towel. In fact, compared to
the rest of the vessel, this compartment seems oddly clean. You guess it must
have been particularly well sealed. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I think I might take a shower.”
Marie tells you, wrapping the towel around herself. “There’s a shower room just
through there.” She nods towards a door across the room.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Good idea.” You reply. “That
should warm you back up.” As she disappears through the door, you throw
yourself down onto one of the couches and puff out your cheeks, feeling like
you could do with a cold shower yourself.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Trent!” You hear Marie call out
a few moments later. You spring to your feet and hurry towards the door to the
shower room.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You okay?” You ask. No response.
“Marie?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">You open the door, the room thick
with a steamy fog. You can see the shower cubicle at the far end of the narrow
room. Through the steam and the frosted glass door of the cubicle, you can just
about make out Marie slumped against one side, groaning. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Marie!” You cry out, fearful
that she’s having an adverse reaction to awakening from cryo-sleep. You wrench
open the glass door to find her smiling back at you, one hand thrust between
her legs and working at her pussy while the other teases a nipple between a
thumb and forefinger.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Waking up from cryo-sleep always
makes me so damn horny.” She purrs, her heavy lidded eyes flicking in your
direction. “Why don’t you come and join me.”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="176.html#Sirens_marieshowerstart" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">Sounds good</a> </p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="175.html#Sirens_marieshowerrefuse" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">No. Something feels off</a></p>
