opposite sex, but something seems off here.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I can’t say I’m not tempted,”
You reply, tearing your tears away from Marie’s naked body, “But I don’t think
that’s a good idea. You’ve just been revived from cryo-sleep and I think you
maybe in shock.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You’re so gallant!” She smiles.
“I can assure you that I’m quite myself. Now, you wouldn’t want to leave a girl
frustrated would you?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You seem to have things in
hand.” You smirk before with an almighty display of willpower you turn to
leave.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I want you.” She tells you, a
note of desperation in her voice. “I need you!”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">Although alarm bells are ringing
in your head, you glance over your shoulder at Marie, the pretty brunette a
vision of desire.</p>
