You grin, quickly shedding your clothes and stepping into the shower with her.
The warm water from the shower head soaks your hair and cascades down your
body. Marie stops pleasuring herself, pushing off the side of the cubicle and
into your arms. Her body moulds itself to yours and you enjoy the feel of her
small, pert breasts crushed against your chest. Your hands slide down her wet
back, cupping her firm buttocks while your lips meet, her tongue flicking
between your lips, seeking and finding your own. You can feel your cock
stiffening between your bodies, aching for stimulation. She breaks the kiss and
pulls back slightly, grinning as she studies your face.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You took some persuading,” She
comments, “But it feels like you’re in the mood now.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’m a gentleman.” You protest
with a smirk.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“That’s a shame.” She smiles,
kissing across your cheek to your ear before whispering, “I thought you might
be a scoundrel.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You’ll have to decide for
yourself.” You reply, arching an eyebrow.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Really?” She breathes excitedly.
“What are you going to do to me?”</p>
