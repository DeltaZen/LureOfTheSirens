your lust overcoming your fears.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You want to shoot your creamy
seed all over my face? That’s so dirty!” She breathes, sitting back and looking
up at you as she continues to stroke your cock. “I think I’d like that.” She
adds with a smile. You take over, stroking your shaft while she caresses her
breasts, teasing her erect nipples. The water cascades down her naked body, her
long, dark brown hair plastered to her shoulders and tops of her glistening
breasts.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’m getting close.” You grunt
through clenched teeth, stroking yourself towards your climax.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Yes Trent.” She moans. “Come for
me. Come all over my face!” With a long, drawn out groan of pleasure, you
erupt, thick pearly fluid spewing from the tip of your engorged cock to
splatter across her features. She lets out a delighted squeak of surprise as
the first spurt streaks up the side of her face. You lean over her, your cock
pulsing again and again as her beautiful face is quickly plastered with your
thick creamy seed. With each pulse, you feel yourself growing weaker, as if you
are fading away with each powerful eruption. As the last weaker spurts dribble
down over your fingers, you sink to your knees, utterly spent. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Something’s wrong.” You groan.
“I don’t feel too good.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I do.” Marie smiles at you, her
splattered visage slowly washed clean by the shower spray, your come sliding
down her face. “I always feel so much better after I’ve consumed my latest
victim. Thank you Trent.” She tells you before her come streaked smile fades to
black as you slip in and out of consciousness. The last thing you see is a vast
chamber covered in blood red tendrils. You fleetingly wonder if this is the
true appearance of whatever is consuming you before you slip away forever.</p>
