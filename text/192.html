taking your cock in one hand and cradling your balls with the other. You smile
weakly, watching as the beautiful brunette rapidly strokes your cock, her
fingers caressing your aching balls. Your head is swimming, but you can feel
the pressure building in your loins and you no longer have the strength to stop
her even if you wanted to. But as your body yearns for blissful release, that’s
the last thing you want, giving yourself over to Marie and her talented hands.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’m… going… to… come…” You tell
her hoarsely, your body slumping forward as you feel the come race up your
shaft to explode all over her firm breasts. Marie squeals with delight,
sweeping your cock from one side to the other as it spurts again and again,
splattering across her soft creamy breasts and pooling in her cleavage. You
groan as she teases the last few drops from your shaft.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Thank you.” She smiles up at
you, collecting your come on her fingertips and transferring it to her lips,
greedily sucking it from her fingers. “It’s been a while since I’ve had
anything substantial to feed upon, so you’re a welcome snack.” She grins up at
you, her lips smeared with your pearly white seed.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Marie?” You croak, grasping the
back of the couch to prevent yourself toppling down on top of her, the strength
evaporating from you with each passing moment.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“A shame you couldn’t have lasted
a bit longer,” She muses sadly, “Though I sense there is another nearby to feed
upon.” You open your mouth to speak, but you can no longer muster the strength
to form words as you teeter on the edge of consciousness. Your vision darkens
and just before you take your last shallow breath, you see a vast chamber
covered in a mass of red tendrils. That too fades as your organs fail and you
become the latest victim of the deadly organism infesting the Magellan.</p>
