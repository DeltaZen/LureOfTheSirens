onto your back and impaling herself on your hard cock. She begins to vigorously
ride you, her pert breasts bouncing in front of you, her damp hair dangling in
your face. You cast your doubts to the back of your mind, giving yourself over
to this beautiful woman, her hypnotic chestnut brown eyes fixed on yours as she
rides you towards your climax. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’m going to come!” You gasp,
your body fatigued to the point of exhaustion with just your lust and
adrenaline driving it on as you feel your balls tightening. You roar with
release as you explode inside her, your cock pulsing again and again as spurt
after spurt streams from the tip into the warm confines of her pussy.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Yes, yes, yes!” Marie cries,
“Give it all to me. Oh it feels so good!” With each powerful twitch of your
cock, you feel progressively weaker until as her pussy teases the last weaker
spurts from your shaft, you feel like you are teetering on the edge of
consciousness.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Marie…” You murmur, your
strength now all but diminished. “Marie…”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You humans are so pathetic.” She
smiles sadly down at you. “One climax is all I ever manage to consume from your
weak race. Give me a Vixian or an Talosian. Even a cockroach would have more
stamina than your wretched species.” You open your mouth to speak, but you no
longer have the strength to form words. Your vision fades to black and just as
the synapses in your brain fire for the last time, you see a vision of a vast
chamber swathed in thin red tendrils. That too fades as your body surrenders
itself and you feel the cold embrace of death, the latest victim of the
parasitic life-form infesting the Magellan.</p>
