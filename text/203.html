give into your lust, your fingers tightening in her hair as you feel your balls
pulse and pump your seed up your shaft. Marie’s cheeks cave in as she sucks the
come from the tip, your hot come splashing against the roof of her mouth,
pulsing again and again. With every spurt, your body feels weaker and the edges
of your vision start to darken. You grit your teeth, fighting to stay conscious
while simultaneously your body jerks and trembles from the pleasurable
sensations radiating out from your groin. As Marie sucks the last of your come
from your cock, she pulls back, gazing up at you and opening her mouth, showing
you a mouthful of pearly white come pooled on her tongue. You let out a moan as
she closes her lips and gulps it down. You try to take a step backwards, but
stumble, dropping to your knees before keeling over onto the floor. Marie gets
to her feet and stands over you, her expression one of complete indifference. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“A tasty snack.” She murmurs to
herself before her brown eyes meet yours and she flashes you a predatory smile.
“Not your seed, human. You.” She steps over your body and even in your weakened
condition, you find your eyes drawn to her firm, pert buttocks. “Even now, I am
consuming you. Soon the life will fade from your body and you will be just
another discarded lifeless husk.” As she wanders away, the room seems to fade,
to be replaced by a vast chamber filled with writhing red tendrils. A moment
later, that too fades as the last of your life force is drawn from your body.</p>
