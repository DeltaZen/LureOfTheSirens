right here and I’m going to find out what it is.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“A pity.” She replies sadly, “You
could have been consumed on the crest of a wave of pleasure, but I guess I’ll
have to devour you the hard way.” Your eyes widen and you take an unsteady step
backwards. Your vision clouds and the room spins around you. You squeeze your
eyes shut as a wave of nausea threatens to overwhelm you. The unpleasant
sensation passes and you open your eyes, starting in surprise as you find
yourself alone in a completely different place. You blink as the new
environment slowly comes into focus. You are lying on your back in a vast
chamber ringed with gantries and staircases stretching up several levels. A
huge steel cylinder dominates the centre of the room and your eyes widen when
you notice the yellow and black radiation warning symbol on the side. You
realise that this must be the Magellan’s reactor chamber. You try to move, but
find your movements are restricted. Panic overwhelms you as you realise that
dozens of dark red tendrils are wrapped around you and attached to your body.
You manage to pull an arm free and quickly tear them from you, each tendril
leaving a bloody mark and an angry weal on your skin where the filaments on
each end had fastened themselves to your body. To your horror and disgust, you
find that several tendrils have snaked down beneath your waistband to your
groin. You cry out in agony as you tear them from the delicate flesh of your
genitals. When you are free of the tendrils, you gingerly get to your feet,
feeling groggy and weak. Your hand reaches for your blaster, but finds only an
empty holster. You curse, looking around you, finding that the tendrils cover
the entire floor of the chamber and stretch up to the levels above, winding
around columns and gantries, spreading like ivy. Amongst the tendrils you can
see other victims. Some are relatively recent, the skin of their corpses
shrivelled and taut around their skeletons, while others are just a collection
of bones. As your eyes search the room, you spot a familiar sight amongst the
lifeless husks. Vanessa lies on her back across the chamber from you, the
tendrils covering her from head to toe. You notice a huge bulkhead door to one
side just a few paces away. It must lead to the service corridor running the
length of the Magellan’s midsection. You glance from the door to Vanessa’s
prone body.</p>
