<p class="msonormal4" id="calibre_pb_410"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="Sirens_savevanessa"></a>“Vanessa!” You rasp, stumbling through the
corpses and bones to where she lies on her back, her body swathed in thin
crimson tendrils. As you pull them from her face, her lids flick open, her eyes
glazed, a beatific smile on her face. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Vanessa!” You shout, shaking
her. “Vanessa! Wake up!” She still won’t stir, so you pull more of the tendrils
from her body trying to free her of their influence. Some of them have snaked
inside her silvery catsuit and as you wrench them from her torso, you notice
that some lead down to her groin. You pull them all free and Vanessa stirs
slightly, before letting out a groan, bringing a relieved smile to your face.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I was having the most wonderful
dream.” Vanessa murmurs, smiling broadly. Her gaze flicks from your face to
your surroundings and her eyes widen, her smile vanishing. “What the fuck?!”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I don’t know.” You reply
earnestly. “But I do know we don’t want to be in here.” You help her to her
feet and she reaches for her blaster, hers still in her holster.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“For once I agree entirely.” She
replies, gazing up at the tendril covered reactor core. You move towards the
heavy bulkhead door and punch the control. They rumble slowly open and you both
squeeze through the gap, thankful to be out of the reactor chamber. As you move
into the service corridor which links the habitation section with the engine
section, you find that the tendrils aren’t confined to the reactor chamber. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’m starting to feel like we’ve
been swallowed alive.” Vanessa comments, looking down the long passageway, the
blood red tendrils covering the walls, floor and ceiling giving the impression
of being inside the throat of some vast leviathan.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I don’t think you’re too far
from the truth.” You reply, as you begin to make your way down the tendril
covered corridor which seems to stretch on forever. “I think whatever this
organism is, it seems to feed on sexual energy, putting erotic visions into our
minds while slowly draining the life from us. I’m surprised it overcame you
though.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’m a biomechanical android,
remember.” She tells you testily. “I may be an artificial life form, but I’m
still a life form.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Point taken.” You reply, nearing
the bulkhead door to the Magellan’s habitation section. Suddenly, an unearthly
bellow echoes down the corridor from behind you and the tendrils suddenly
become a writhing mass around you. They lash at your bodies, trying to wrap
around your limbs. </p>
