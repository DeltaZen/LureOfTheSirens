<p class="msonormal5">“Where?” She replies, the
corridor filled with flailing tendrils</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Anywhere!” You tell her. “You
can’t miss!” She fires intermittently into the walls and floor of the corridor.
An otherworldly cry echoes from the reactor chamber and the thrashing tendrils
stop, the corridor suddenly still again. You dash for the bulkhead door,
quickly squeezing through the gap as it slowly slides open and emerging into a
familiar location. You are standing in the crew lounge you had entered earlier,
though now there is a thick layer of dust and grime over everything and all the
cryo-tubes stand empty and unused. You realise that you must have been under
the thrall of the organism from the moment you stepped into this room and never
saw the real interior, just the construct it had formed in your mind. You move
towards the door leading to the corridor back to the Eclipse.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Wait!” Vanessa calls out from
behind you. You turn to find her standing there with her blaster levelled at
your head.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What the fuck?!” You exclaim,
your eyes widening.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Get out of the way!” She yells
at you. She fires, the shot sizzling over your head. You turn to see tendrils
hanging down from a vent above the door quickly retracting out of sight.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Thanks.” You tell her, glancing
nervously up at the vent as you move quickly through the door and into the dusty
corridor beyond.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What now?” Vanessa asks.</p>
