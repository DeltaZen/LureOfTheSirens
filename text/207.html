better.” You tell Vanessa. “We’ll destroy the Magellan from space.” Vanessa
nods her agreement and you hurry towards the airlock.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">Moments later, you slip into your
seat and retract the docking tube, manoeuvring away from the infested old
vessel. When you are at a safe distance, you swing the ship around.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Lock on to the engine section.”
You tell her. “We’ll shoot a load it won’t like.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Locked on.” Vanessa confirms.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Open fire.” You watch with
satisfaction as plasma energy bolts streak across space, impacting on the hull
of the Magellan’s engine section. There is a blinding flash of light as the
reactor is breached and the entire aft section of the ancient vessel explodes,
sending the forward section tumbling through space to smash into a nearby wreck
of a bulk freighter. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’m no longer reading any life
signs.” Vanessa comments, studying the instruments in front of her.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Good.” You reply grimly,
watching as glowing debris from the obliterated wreck streaks away in all
directions like sparks from a firework.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Think we’ll get a bonus for
this?” Vanessa asks with a raised eyebrow.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I doubt it.” You chuckle, “But
we’ll be claiming salvage rights on all these ships.” You drop a buoy
registering your claim and flash a grin at Vanessa. “We’re going to be rich
Vanessa, very rich.”</p>
