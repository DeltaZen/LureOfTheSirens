self-destruct.” You tell her. “We won’t have the codes, so you’ll have to try
to interface with the ship’s computer.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“No problem.” Vanessa replies as
you both stride purposefully towards the bridge.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">The door slides open and you scan
the banks of dusty consoles. Vanessa is way ahead of you and sits down at the
engineering station. As she connects remotely with the computer, she sits stock
still, her eyes glowing blue.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Connecting…” She tells you, her
voice strangely emotionless as her computer mind takes over. “Connected.
Accessing secure command functions. Firewall in place. Breaching. Firewall
breached. Accessing self-destruct sequence. Setting self-destruct. Countdown?”
Vanessa’s head twists stiffly towards you, her shining blue pupiless eyes
gazing up at you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Five minutes.” You tell her.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Self-destruct countdown set for
five minutes.” She confirms. “Activating.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“WARNING! SELF DESTRUCT SYSTEM
ACTIVATED.” The ship’s computer booms out across the bridge. “YOU HAVE FIVE
MINUTES TO REACH MINIMUM SAFE DISTANCE.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Time to leave.” You tell
Vanessa, tugging at her arm. The blue glow in her eyes fades and she blinks as
she disconnects from the engineering station. She gets to her feet and you
hurry back down the corridor towards the airlock leading to the Eclipse.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">As you near the airlock, you
slide to a halt.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Shit.” You murmur, as you
realise that the tendrils have snaked down the corridor from the crew lounge
and writhe around the airlock door, your route back to your ship now blocked.
Vanessa pushes past you and advances towards them.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What are you doing?” You ask,
grasping her arm. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“If they take me, they’ll drag me
back towards the reactor chamber.” She replies. “You should have a clear run to
the airlock.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“No!” You tell her. “I’m not
letting you sacrifice yourself. There must be another way.” </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’m all ears.” Vanessa smiles
grimly. You can tell in her eyes that she has already made up her mind. You
frantically try to think of an alternative, wondering if there is enough time
to abort the self-destruct. If there isn’t, you’ll both die. You notice some
pipes running along the ceiling of the corridor and wonder what they are. It
might be something harmless like water or something like gas that will turn the
whole corridor into an inferno, burning the tendrils and both of you. You ask
yourself whether you are willing to gamble your own life to save the “life” of
an android.</p>
