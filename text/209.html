the ceiling. She turns to you quizzically before shrugging and firing at the
pipes above the writhing red tendrils. The pipes rupture and liquid showers
down onto them. Your shoulders slump as you realise it must just be a water
pipe.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Look!” Vanessa points excitedly.
Vapour rises from the tendrils and their movement becomes sluggish before
stopping all together. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“It’s a coolant pipe!” You grin.
“It’s frozen them solid.” Vanessa again takes aim and fires, the tendrils
shattering like porcelain. You hear a booming roar of fury echoing down the
corridors of the ancient vessel as you hurry towards the airlock.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">Moments later, you slide into
your seats in the Eclipse’s cockpit and hurriedly disengage the docking clamps
and retract the docking tube.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Less than a minute until
detonation.” Vanessa tells you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“It’s going to be tight.” You
reply as you manoeuvre the ship away from the Magellan, threading it through
the various broken hulls and pieces of wreckage.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Kind of makes you wonder why we
didn’t allow ourselves a longer countdown.” Vanessa comments wryly. You grit
your teeth and accelerate weaving through the debris, a bead of sweat running
down your forehead as you concentrate.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Three… Two… One…” Vanessa
whispers beside you. A flash reflects off the battered hull of a huge wreck
ahead and a moment later the ship is buffeted by the shockwave of the nuclear
detonation, nearly shaking you both from your seats. You swing the ship around
and head back towards the Magellan, but find only particles and tiny pieces of
debris, the infested old ship utterly destroyed.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Think we’ll get a bonus for
this?” Vanessa asks with a raised eyebrow.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I doubt it.” You chuckle, “But
we’ll be claiming salvage rights on all these ships.” You drop a buoy
registering your claim and flash a grin at Vanessa. “We’re going to be rich
Vanessa, very rich.”</p>
