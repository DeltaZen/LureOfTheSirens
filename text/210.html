has come to this. Vanessa smiles sadly, leaning into you and pressing her lips
to yours. You kiss tenderly for a moment before she pulls away. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Please don’t.” You tell her, the
words catching in your throat.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“There’s no other way.” She tells
you. “Ultimately, you’re a life form and I’m a machine. I’m expendable.” </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You’re not expendable.” You tell
her weakly. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Let me do this for you.” She
smiles. “I’ve got to do this.” With that she turns and walks towards the
thrashing tendrils. With one last longing look over her shoulder, she steps
into the writhing mass which quickly wrap around her limbs, pulling her from
her feet and dragging her down the corridor towards the crew lounge. She
doesn’t make a sound as she is pulled away from you, disappearing swiftly into
the darkness at the far end of the long passageway. Feeling wracked with guilt,
you step into the airlock and board the Eclipse. </p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">Sliding into your seat in the
cockpit, you quickly disengage docking clamps and manoeuvre away from the
hulking vessel. You have just about reached a safe distance when you see the
flash of the detonation reflected in the pieces of debris tumbling through
space all around you. You brace yourself and a moment later the ship shakes
violently as the shockwave buffets the vessel. After it passes, you swing the
ship around, but the Magellan has been utterly destroyed.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Vanessa, I’m sorry.” You
whisper, choking back the tears and trying to keep your mind occupied with the
ship’s readouts. </p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">With the organism destroyed, its
influence over this part of space is ended and you soon leave the graveyard of
disabled ships behind. With a heavy heart, you plot a course for Omega station
and take the Eclipse back into hyperspace.</p>
