firmly. “We’ll go back to the bridge and abort the self destruct. Give
ourselves some time to figure this out.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">Vanessa nods and you hurry back
along the corridor towards the bridge.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">You move towards the computer
console, the timer reading 0:57 until detonation.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Quickly!” You urge Vanessa.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I can read.” She snaps, her eyes
glowing blue as she connects to the ship’s computer. You watch nervously as the
timer continues to countdown. At 0:21, Vanessa’s eyes return to their usual
appearance and she turns towards you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’m sorry, there’s too many
firewalls in place.” She tells you. “I can’t get through them all in time.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">You glance at the countdown, now
reading 0:12 and reach out, grasping her hand and squeezing it, your eyes
meeting hers as you prepare yourself for the end.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You always were an arsehole,
Trent.” Vanessa smiles sadly, leaning forward and kissing you tenderly just as
the counter reaches zero and the Magellan is consumed by a huge nuclear
detonation, your bodies vaporised instantly.</p>
