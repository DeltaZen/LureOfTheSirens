through the mass of writhing tendrils, thrashing around you like a thousand
sightless red snakes. You duck and jump over them, making it to the door. As
you jab your finger on the door open button, Vanessa screams out behind you and
you turn just as one wraps around her ankle, tripping her up. She falls,
sprawling to the floor, her blaster flying from her hand to be quickly buried among
the vine-like tendrils. As Vanessa tries to pull the tendrils from her ankle,
more wrap around her, lashing around her arms and pinning her to the floor.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Trent!” She cries out, looking
up at you, helpless.</p>
