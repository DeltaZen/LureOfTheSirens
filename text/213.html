There’s nothing you can do for her now.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’m sorry Vanessa.” You tell
her, genuine anguish in your voice as you step through the door.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“No Trent!” She implores you
desperately. “Please! Don’t leave me! I…” Her last sentence is cut abruptly
short as the door slides shut behind you. You stand there for a moment, the
guilt weighing heavily on you before finally taking in your surroundings. You
are standing in the crew lounge you had entered earlier, though now there is a
thick layer of dust and grime over everything and all the cryo-tubes stand
empty and unused. You realise that you must have been under the thrall of the
organism from the moment you stepped into this room and never saw the real
interior, just the construct it had formed in your mind. You look around,
looking for tendrils, but see none. Breathing a sigh of relief, you step
towards the door to the corridor leading back to the Eclipse. You never spot
the thin tendrils hanging, lying in wait from a vent just above the door. As
you reach the door, they reach down, wrapping tightly around your throat and
lifting you from the floor. You scream soundlessly as the tendrils choke the
life from you, your hands clawing futilely at the red strands constricting
around your neck, your legs flailing uselessly in the air. Within a few
moments, your body hangs limp, the latest victim of the parasitic creature
infesting the Magellan.</p>
