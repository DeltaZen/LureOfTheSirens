reach the bulkhead door. With one last rueful look at Vanessa’s prone form, you
remind yourself that ultimately she is just a machine and not worth risking
your life for. You punch the door open button and the heavy, armoured doors
rumble slowly open. You squeeze through the gap and begin to run down the
corridor. The tendrils have covered the service corridor too, the long
passageway transformed into a blood-red mass of vines. You stumble through
them, the narrow corridor seeming to continue forever. You hear an unearthly
roar behind you and the tendrils suddenly come to life, writhing around you and
lashing at your body as you sprint down the corridor. The tendrils wrap around
you, pulling you back. As you struggle to free yourself, more and more wrap
around your legs and arms. With a cry of anguish, you are pulled from your
feet, more tendrils wrapping around you and dragging you back towards the
reactor chamber. You find yourself just a few paces from Vanessa’s blissfully
oblivious form, gazing at her powerlessly as you are slowly and painfully
drained of life force over the next two days before you finally succumb. The
tendrils complete their work, leaving your corpse as the latest husk-like
victim of the strange organism that has infested the Magellan.</p>
