<p class="msonormal4" id="calibre_pb_432"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="Sirens_corridorsave"></a>“Vanessa!” You cry out, starting back towards
her. The tendrils fill the air around you and you yell out as they wrap around
your legs, binding them together and sending you crashing to the floor next to
her. You reach out, your fingertips falling just short of her own outstretched
hand.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’m sorry Trent.” She tells you
as the tendrils begin to drag her back along the corridor towards the reactor
chamber. The tendrils wrap around you and you struggle futilely against them.
Your hand sinks into the red carpet of tendrils and you feel a familiar shape
against your fingers. You pull Vanessa’s blaster from the spongy mass and open
fire, energy blasts peppering the mass of vine-like strands. You hear a roar of
pain echoing down the corridor from the reactor chamber and the tendrils
slacken their grip on you. You struggle free of them and race after Vanessa,
blasting the tendrils around her. Again the organism’s otherworldly bellow
fills the air and the tendrils release Vanessa and stop their writhing, the
corridor again growing dormant. Your euphoria is short-lived as you realise the
tendrils have badly injured Vanessa, crushing her body beneath their
constricting wraps.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You’re going to be ok.” You tell
her hoarsely, dropping to your knees next to her badly misshapen form.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You always were a terrible
liar.” Vanessa smiles weakly, before coughing up a mouthful of green hydraulic
fluid. “Listen, I don’t have long. I know you’ve always questioned what was
real and what was programmed. I always wish I could have eased your doubts, but
perhaps now I’m at my end you can truly believe me. I don’t know if an android
could ever really love someone, but if they can, then know that I love you and
have done for a long, long time. I might have been manufactured for sex, but I
never truly enjoyed it until I was with you. You made me feel… human…” She
smiles one last time before the light in her eyes dims and her hydraulics
finally fail, her head flopping to one side.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Goddamn it Vanessa.” You murmur,
tears stinging your eyes, squeezing her hand tightly as if that will bring her
back. You wipe the tears from your cheeks with the back of your hand, telling
yourself she’s nothing but a damn machine and you certainly wouldn’t have got
emotional about a broken power coupling or fuel valve. You remind yourself that
Vanessa was nothing but a partner and a convenient outlet for your lustful
urges. You laugh out loud, knowing that you’re only kidding yourself, before
letting go, pressing your lips to hers one last time and weeping for the woman
you loved.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">The organism, obviously wary of
your blaster, leaves you unmolested as you make your way back to your ship. You
pass through the crew lounge you had entered earlier, surprised to find a thick
layer of dust and grime over everything and all the cryo-tubes standing empty
and unused. You realise that you must have been under the thrall of the
organism from the moment you stepped into this room and never saw the real
interior, just the construct it had formed in your mind. You reach the Eclipse
and quickly withdraw the docking tube, leaving the Magellan behind before
swinging around and targeting the engine and reactor section.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“This is for you, Vanessa.” You
murmur grimly before opening fire, bolts of plasma energy lighting up space as
they shoot towards the ancient vessel. They rip into the Magellan’s hull and
there is a blinding light as the nuclear reactor explodes, ripping the vessel
apart, the debris tumbling through space to smash into nearby wrecks.
Satisfied, you weave your way through the debris field away from what is left
of the Magellan. </p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">With the organism destroyed, its
influence over this part of space is ended and you soon leave the graveyard of
disabled ships and battered debris behind. You plot a course for Omega station
and take the Eclipse back into hyperspace.</p>
