planet.” You sigh reluctantly. Vanessa nods, her fingers flying over the
console in front of her.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Eridani II is closest, just a
couple of hours away.” She tells you. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Do it.” You reply curtly,
annoyed by this latest inconvenience.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">Two hours later you drop out of
hyperspace and enter orbit around Eridani II. The only inhabited planet in the
system, Eridani II is an ocean planet but with huge rocky islands floating in
the sky over the watery surface. The islands vary greatly in size from some not
much larger than boulders, to others hundreds of miles across. You take the
controls as you enter the atmosphere, swooping low towards the azure seas
before levelling off and streaking towards one of the cities, the huge
sprawling metropolis’s skyscrapers extending high above the rocky island and
hanging down from the underside like glassy cuboid stalactites. As you reach
the underside of the city, you expertly pilot the ship through the forest of
hanging skyscrapers before bringing the Eclipse in to land in a hanger built
into the side of one of the larger buildings.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Let’s go find Hector.” You say,
climbing out of your seat.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You know how I feel about that
pervert.” Vanessa growls.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“It’s not like we have much of a
choice is it?” You reply. “And we need his help, so play nice.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">You step down the boarding ramp
and see Hector put down a plasma cutter and pull up his protective goggles. He
is one of the indigenous Eridanians and as he strolls towards you, his scaly
lips curl into a smile.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Trent, my old friend!” He calls
out, his voice echoing in the cavernous hanger. The Eridanians, though
humanoid, share many characteristics with reptiles. They are cold blooded with
scaly, leathery light green skin and no hair, their heads crested to the back
of their skulls.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Hector.” You smile, shaking his
hand. “Good to see you.” </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“And you.” He nods before his
eyes flick to Vanessa. “And especially you my dear.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">He takes her hand and stoops,
pressing his lips to it. She glares at you, showing her distaste. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Now what have you done to the
Eclipse this time?” He asks, gazing up at the boxy freighter. Hector has
carried out a number of repairs for you over the years and knows the ship well.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Hyperspace coil on engine two’s
running hot.” Vanessa replies.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You make me run hot every time I
see you.” Hector grins wolfishly, his gaze dropping to Vanessa’s breasts.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You want to keep your eyes,
you’d best look elsewhere.” Vanessa growls. Hector’s smile falters slightly,
but he recovers quickly.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Such fire. I like that in a
woman.” He grins, before turning back to you. “I’ll take a look at the coil.
It’ll likely take a few hours to repair. You’re welcome to stay here and wait,
or go for a wander around the city. Topside’s beautiful this time of year.”</p>
