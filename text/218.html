Hector. He nods and with one last leer in Vanessa’s direction, turns his
attention to your ship.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">You make your way from the
hanger, walking along the suspended streets of the underside, supporting struts
and steelwork stretching up to their fixing points in the rocky underside of
the floating island. Even during the day, with the underside forever in shadow,
the streets are in an eerie twilight. </p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">You reach a terminal and board a
huge turbo lift which quickly takes you through the core of the floating island
to the upper surface. You emerge from the busy turbo lift terminal into the sun
drenched, gleaming streets of the rich topside district. Monolithic glass
skyscrapers tower all around you as you make your way through the bustling
streets towards the Balcony, topside’s main tourist attraction. You know the
way, but even if you didn’t, you’d just need to follow the sound of roaring
water.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">A few minutes later, you step out
onto the broad terrace overlooking a huge waterfall which cascades down from
high above you before dropping into the sea several hundred yards below. Groups
of tourists of various species admire the view, gathering near the edge of the
terrace and cooing in wonder. Expensive bars and restaurants catering to an
intergalactic clientele are arrayed behind you, but even with the rampant
commercialisation, nothing can detract from the natural beauty of the
waterfall.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Even though we’ve been here
before, it still takes my breath away.” Vanessa murmurs in awe, leaning on the
railing and gazing out at the falls. “Thank you. I don’t think I could have
tolerated that pervert for another moment.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Is one sex obsessed reprobate in
your life enough?” You grin.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You said it.” She chuckles, her
long red hair blowing in the gentle breeze. “What do you want to do now?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="220.html#Eridani_bar" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">Have a drink in a bar</a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"> </p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="219.html#Eridani_backtohanger" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">Time is of the essence. Get
back to the hanger and see if Hector has repaired the hyperspace coil</a></p>
