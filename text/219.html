“We’ll see how Hector is getting on with that hyperspace coil.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You really know how to treat a
girl.” Vanessa replies acidly, taking one last longing look at the picturesque
waterfall as you turn to leave.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“When we’ve claimed our bounty
for this job, we’ll have plenty of time to enjoy ourselves.” You reply as you
begin to retrace your steps back towards the turbo lift terminus.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“That’s what you said last time.”
Vanessa grumbles, falling into step beside you. </p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">As you walk across the hanger
towards the Eclipse, your footsteps echoing through the cavernous space, Hector
looks up from behind the open engine housing. Your heart sinks when you see his
grim expression.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“It’s not good news.” Hector
tells you as you reach him, wiping his hands on an oily rag. “I’ve patched the
hyperspace coil up as best I can, but it’s on its last legs.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“How long until it fails?” You
ask him.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Difficult to say.” Hector
shrugs. “Today, tomorrow, next week. But it will fail and soon. You need a
replacement and I don’t have any.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Know anyone that does?” Vanessa
asks.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Afraid not.” He grimaces. “Blame
your partner there for owning an antique. They just don’t make coils like this
anymore.” He pauses, deep in thought for a moment. “Having said that, it’s a
long shot but…”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What?” You ask, brightening.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“There’s a scrapyard on a nearby
island west of here.” Hector replies, stroking his chin. “It’s mainly rusty
junk and the proprietor is a little on the eccentric side, but if your luck
holds out, there may be a hyperspace coil you can use. Equally, you might just
be wasting your time.”</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="239.html#Eridani_scrapyard" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">Try the scrapyard island</a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"> </p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="241.html#Eridani_riskit" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">Get back into space and hope your
patched up hyperspace coil holds out</a></p>
