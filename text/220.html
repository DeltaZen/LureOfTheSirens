<p class="msonormal5">“Sounds good.” She smiles,
turning away from the waterfall.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“But not one of these soulless
places.” You gesture derisively at the upmarket bars behind you. “There’s a bar
I know a few streets away from all the tourists. A place with a bit more
character.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You mean a dive full of
lowlifes.” Vanessa replies rolling her eyes.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Our kind of place.” You grin.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Speak for yourself.” Vanessa
growls before letting out a sigh of resignation. “Lead on.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">A few minutes later, you descend
a flight of steps into the dingy interior of the bar. The air is thick with
smoke and pungent with the smell of stale beer and the body odour of several
different species of alien. You approach the bar and order some drinks from an
Eridanian barman with a jagged scar down his cheek. Moments later he returns,
slamming the glasses down before you, the beer spilling onto the bar. You gulp
down half the glass before letting out a satisfied sigh. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I must admit I had reservations,
but this is a fine establishment.” Vanessa comments dryly, glancing around at
the rough looking clientele before sipping at her own drink. Her biomechanical
innards would convert the drink into various lubricants and though she wouldn’t
become intoxicated by the alcohol content, she was programmed to simulate the
effects and act accordingly.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“It has a certain bohemian
charm.” You shrug apologetically.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Trent.” Rasps a voice behind
you. Your shoulders drop, recognising the voice.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Grimm!” You smile, turning to
face the stocky giant of a man. His shaven head has the appearance of being
roughly carved from granite and he regards you coolly with his one remaining
eye. “Good to lay eyes on one another! Well, eye.” You wince. “How long has it
been?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Since you cut and ran with all
the loot and left me to be taken in?” Grimm growls.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“A long time.” You muse, your
hand resting on your blaster and hoping Vanessa is doing the same. “A lot of
water under a lot of bridges since then eh?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Not for me.” He replies, his eye
widening and his nostrils flaring. “You don’t know how many nights in Titan
prison I dreamt about making you suffer.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We all have a dream.” You grin,
weighing up your options.</p>
