<p class="msonormal4" id="calibre_pb_444"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="Eridani_captive"></a>You awake in a gloomy, dilapidated warehouse. You
are sitting on the cold, damp floor and are propped up against a steel column,
your hands tied behind your back. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Awake are you?” Vanessa asks
tetchily. You glance to your right and find she is tied to the next column. The
cavernous interior of the warehouse is empty and only a few of the lights
dangling from the ceiling are operational, leaving most of it in shadow. From
the musty smell and the steady dripping of water through the ceiling, you guess
you’ve been taken back to the underside and probably aren’t far from Hector’s
hanger. If you can just engineer an escape, you might yet get out of this.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Yeah.” You reply groggily, your
head aching from the impact of the brutal head-butt. “You okay?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Oh, I’m just peachy!” Comes the
sarcastic response.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I thought I heard voices.” A
booming voice echoes from across the warehouse. Grimm emerges from the shadows,
his feet splashing in puddles that have formed on the floor. He is flanked by
one of his henchmen, though as they draw closer, you realise it is a
henchwoman. Human, attractive and from the look of her, with her long lustrous
black hair and light brown skin, is of Persian descent. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Apologies for the
accommodation.” He grins as he reaches you. “But I needed to bring you
somewhere out of the way. If it’s any consolation, you won’t be here for long,
though your short stay will be an eventful one, I promise you.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Surely we can come to an
agreement.” You reply, your tone far more confident than you feel. “One with
less violence, for old times’ sake.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You’re not talking your way out
of this one Trent.” He tells you darkly. “You’re going to pay for your betrayal
and then I’m going to drop you into the ocean, piece by wretched piece.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">A communicator bleeps on the
woman’s belt.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Who the fuck is that Yasmin?”
Grimm snarls irritably. Yasmin pulls the communicator from her belt and speaks
tersely into it.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Something’s come up.” She tells
Grimm. “They need you in the other room.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">Grimm curses and turns back to
you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“To be continued.” He spits
malevolently before stomping away across the warehouse in Yasmin’s wake, his
eyes on her leather clad buttocks.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Hey, how about some water?” You
call out. “The threat of dismemberment always gives me a thirst.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’ll think about it.” He growls
before disappearing through a door.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Any ideas about how we’re
getting out of this one?” Vanessa asks. You try pulling your hands through your
bonds, but succeed only in giving yourself painful rope burns on your wrists.
You rack your brains for another way out, but nothing springs to mind.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Not currently.” You admit.
“You?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“He’s got a soft spot for
Yasmin.” Vanessa observes. “I can mimic her look and try to seduce him?”</p>
