Vanessa, ignoring the pang of guilt at what you are asking of her. Vanessa nods
and you wait for Grimm to return.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">A few minutes later, Yasmin
brings you both water and a few minutes after that, Grimm returns.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Now Trent, my old friend!” He
grins, pulling a large knife from his belt. “We won’t have any more
interruptions, so we can discuss your betrayal at length.” He advances
threateningly towards you, the blade glinting in his hand.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Grimm.” Vanessa calls out.
“Whatever happened between you two is not my affair. I’m just a gun for hire
and have no loyalty to Trent. How about you let me go and I’ll leave you to do
what you have to do.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I don’t think so.” He grins.
“I’m smarter than I look.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“How about I sweeten the deal?”
She smiles sexily, before gazing pointedly at his groin and licking her lips.
He smiles, considering it for a moment before slowly shaking his head.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Tempting sweetheart, but I don’t
trust you.” He tells her. “You’re a beautiful woman, but not that beautiful.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Really?” She smiles, her pale
skin darkening to a light brown and her hair becoming a glossy black. Her green
eyes become a smouldering dark brown and her voluptuous body becomes lithe and
athletic. “How about now?” Though not an exact match for Yasmin, there is a
definite resemblance and one that is not lost on Grimm.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You’re an android!” He remarks
incredulously, his eyes drinking her in. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Yes.” She smiles. “As I said, my
first loyalty is to myself, so you have nothing to fear from me. Now, how about
that deal sweetener and then I’ll leave you to do as you will to my former
partner.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You bitch!” You snarl at
Vanessa, trying to sell the ruse as Grimm uses the knife to cut her free before
tucking it back in his belt and helping her to her feet. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Sorry, but this isn’t my
quarrel.” Vanessa shrugs, rubbing her wrists before turning to Grimm. “Where
shall we take this?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Right here’s fine.” He grins. “I
want you to suck my cock while Trent watches.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">Vanessa smiles and drops to her
knees before him, her hands fumbling at his groin. She pulls out his cock,
wrapping her fingers around his length and stroking his rapidly growing shaft
to its fully engorged size.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“It’s so big!” She coos, her
brown fingers sliding up and down his length. “And so thick! I’m not sure it
will fit in my mouth.” She smiles up at him.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We’ll see about that.” He
grunts, thrusting his pelvis forward. Grimm is just in front of you and you wonder
if you could trip him if you lashed out with a leg. Vanessa could then
overpower him. Risky, but it will save her going any further with this sordid
business.</p>
