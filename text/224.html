your foot across Grimm’s shin. He roars in surprise and anger, dropping
painfully to his knees, his cock slipping from Vanessa’s grasp. She quickly
overcomes her own astonishment and lunges for the knife in his belt.
Unfortunately, Grimm reacts first, pulling the knife free and thrusting it into
Vanessa’s neck. Her mouth drops open and electricity arcs down the length of
the long blade, burning Grimm. He curses, letting go of the knife and grasping
his injured hand. Vanessa falls backwards, her head twisted towards you, her
lifeless eyes seeming to gaze up at you accusingly.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Nice try Trent.” He tells you,
glancing sadly at the knife imbedded in Vanessa. “I was going to gut you with
that knife. No matter…”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">He advances towards you and gets
you in a headlock. He twists your head around and you cry out in agony. The
last thing you hear is a loud, sickening click as he snaps your neck.</p>
