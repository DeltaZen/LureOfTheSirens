at the same time, you’ll be forever looking over your shoulder if you let Grimm
live.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Do it.” You reluctantly tell
Vanessa, wincing as the blade flashes and Grimm gurgles in a shower of his own
blood, twitching for a few moments before lying still. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Thank you.” You tell Vanessa, as
she gets to her feet and steps over Grimm’s corpse. She returns to her usual
redheaded incarnation before untying your bonds. “I’m sorry you had to do that.
I owe you one.” </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Don’t worry, I won’t forget.”
Vanessa tells you grimly. “Now let’s get out of here.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">You cross the warehouse away from
the door from which Grimm had emerged and carefully open another door. Relieved
to find it unguarded, you slip out into the suspended street outside.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We’re not far from Hector’s
hanger.” You tell Vanessa, recognising your location. “We’re on the same level
and it’s only ten minutes’ walk from here.” Vanessa nods distractedly, a
faraway look in her eyes. “You okay?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I don’t know.” She shrugs. “It’s
not like we haven’t killed anyone before. They’ve normally got a gun in their
hand, that’s all.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“He was no less dangerous.” You
reassure her, though it’s not sitting well with your conscience either. “He’d
have chased us across the galaxy in pursuit of his misguided vengeance.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">Vanessa nods and you walk on in
silence.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">You are nearly back to the hanger
when you hear a commotion behind you. You turn to see Yasmin and the rest of
Grimm’s cohorts chasing after you. They are still a distance behind, but
closing fast. Without your blasters, your only option is to try to outpace
them.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Quick, run!” You tell Vanessa,
breaking into a sprint, the lights of Hector’s hanger just ahead.</p>
