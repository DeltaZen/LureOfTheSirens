rolls her eyes and you gaze at Grimm’s defiant face. Tempting as it would be to
leave his corpse behind, you did leave him to take the fall all those years
ago.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“No, we’re not murderers.” You
tell Vanessa before turning to Grimm. “I didn’t betray you on that job. You got
caught, I didn’t. It was as simple as that. I’d say after this little
misunderstanding, we’re even. Would you agree?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Not like I have a choice.” Grimm
replies, Vanessa’s blade still at his throat.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I thought you’d see it that
way.” You grin before your smile vanishes. “But know that if our paths should
cross again in the future,” You add darkly, “I won’t be feeling so charitable.
Understood?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Yeah.” Grimm spits. Vanessa
carefully slips the blade from his throat before smashing the handle into the
side of his head, knocking him unconscious. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Thank you.” You tell Vanessa, as
she gets to her feet and steps over Grimm’s unconscious form. She returns to
her usual redheaded incarnation before untying your bonds. “I owe you one.” </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’ll add it to your tally.”
Vanessa grins. “Now let’s get out of here.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">You cross the warehouse away from
the door from which Grimm had emerged and carefully open another door. Relieved
to find it unguarded, you slip out into the suspended street outside.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We’re not far from Hector’s
hanger.” You tell Vanessa, recognising your location. “We’re on the same level
and it’s only ten minutes’ walk from here. This was easier than I thought.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Speak for yourself.” Vanessa
grumbles, sticking her tongue out and grimacing.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You didn’t have to finish him
off.” You point out.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I did get a bit carried away.”
Vanessa admits with a sheepish smile, blushing.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">You are nearly back to the hanger
when you hear a commotion behind you. You turn to see Yasmin and the rest of
Grimm’s cohorts chasing after you. They are still a distance behind, but
closing fast. Without your blasters, your only option is to try to outpace
them.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Quick, run!” You tell Vanessa,
breaking into a sprint, the lights of Hector’s hanger just ahead.</p>
