“Yasmin should be back soon. Even tied up, I can best that waif of a girl.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">A few minutes later, Yasmin
crosses the warehouse towards you, a cup of water in each hand. She reaches
Vanessa first, carefully guiding the cup to her lips and tipping it up, Vanessa
sipping from it. She then moves across to you, her eyes narrowed warily. She
raises the glass to your lips and you make a show of struggling.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Please, closer.” You ask her
hoarsely. She moves closer, just letting her guard down for a moment and you
strike, smashing your head into hers. She reels backwards in surprise and you
sweep her legs out from under her with yours. She crashes to the ground, her
head hitting the ground hard and knocking her unconscious. You feel a pang of
guilt at knocking out a woman, but remind yourself that she is a violent
mercenary thug. You quickly swing around the column with your back to her,
blindly stretching out with your hands to try to grasp her knife.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Quickly!” Vanessa hisses.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Not helping!” You shoot back as
you stretch out, feeling the knife handle with your fingertips. You work it out
of her belt and quickly manipulate it, slicing through the ropes binding your
wrists. You get to your feet and cut Vanessa free, the redhead rubbing her wrists
and glancing with apprehension at the door, perhaps expecting Grimm to return
at any moment. As you hurry across the warehouse in the opposite direction
towards another door, you hear Yasmin let out a groggy groan behind you.
Relieved to find the door unguarded, you slip out into the suspended street
outside.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We’re not far from Hector’s
hanger.” You tell Vanessa, recognising the location. “We’re on the same level
and it’s only ten minutes’ walk from here.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You are a lucky son of a bitch.”
Vanessa shakes her head at you, a smile playing at the corners of her mouth.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">You are nearly back to the hanger
when you hear a commotion behind you. You turn to see Grimm and the rest of his
cohorts chasing after you. They are still a distance behind, but closing fast.
Without your blasters, your only option is to try to outpace them.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Quick, run!” You tell Vanessa,
breaking into a sprint, the lights of Hector’s hanger just ahead.</p>
