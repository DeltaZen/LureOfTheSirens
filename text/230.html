“No woman can resist the legendary Trent charm offensive.” Vanessa mutters
something under her breath you can’t quite make out. “What?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Nothing.” She replies, a hint of
exasperation in her voice. “I guess a longshot’s better than nothing.” </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Your confidence in me is
inspiring.” You deadpan. “Trust me. We’ll get out of this yet.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">A few minutes later, Yasmin makes
her way across the warehouse towards you, a cup of water in her hand.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Don’t try anything stupid.” She
warns you. “Grimm doesn’t want anyone else to kill you, but he’s a little
vaguer on torture.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Just what I need, a tall drink
of water.” You grin, your eyes sliding up and down Yasmin’s body. She gazes
warily back at you. Unperturbed, you continue: “Now, how did a pretty girl like
you get caught up in this life?” </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Hmmm, let me think.” She tilts
her head to one side and chews her lip, apparently deep in thought.
“Dedication, hard work and borderline psychotic tendencies.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I always find that driven,
career women like yourself tend to neglect the simple pleasures in life.” You
gaze into her dark brown eyes. “A beautiful sunset, fine cuisine, the
passionate embrace of a man…”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Not going to work.” Yasmin
interrupts with a wry smile. “I’m afraid I’m immune to your charms. But don’t
take it personally,” she glances across at Vanessa, “She’s more my type. But in
any case, you’re wasting your breath. I’m not stupid enough to cross Grimm. You
two are testament to the perils of that. The man holds a grudge.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">At that moment, Grimm steps
through the door and strides across the warehouse towards you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Any last words Trent.” He grins,
brandishing a large knife, the blade catching the light as he advances towards
you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Just two.” You reply defiantly.
“Fuck. You.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Don’t do this Grimm.” Vanessa
implores him, panic in her voice. “Don’t kill him!”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Don’t worry.” Grimm grins
humourlessly at her. “I’m not a sadistic man. Much as I’m tempted, I won’t make
him suffer.” He turns back to you, his smile twisting into a scowl. “For old
times’ sake.” He thrusts the blade deep into your chest and you cry out in
agony, your mouth filling with blood. As you breathe your last, painful,
gurgling breath, you hear Vanessa’s cries of anguish as she watches you die.</p>
