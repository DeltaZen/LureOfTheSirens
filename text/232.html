your pursuers’ line of sight, you drag Vanessa into the entrance of one of the
many lavish though overpriced retail establishments lining the streets. You
step through the door of the boutique, finding yourself amongst racks of fine
evening wear.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“May I help you sir?” A prissy
sales assistant asks, her eyes looking you up and down before gazing at you
with obvious contempt. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Maybe later.” You grin wolfishly
with a raised eyebrow. She gasps in disgust and storms away. Vanessa shakes her
head at you and you turn your attention to the street outside. You duck back as
your pursuers appear, glancing about them, one, a particularly savage looking
Proxian looks right at the boutique. You are sure he is staring right at you
and your hand tightens on your blaster, but after a moment he turns and races
down the street after the rest of Grimm’s cohorts. Vanessa’s expression mirrors
your own as you breathe a sigh of relief. You blow the glowering sales
assistant a kiss as you leave and cautiously make your way through the crowded
streets towards the turbo lifts.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">You approach the domed terminus
building for the turbo lifts, pleased with yourself for giving Grimm’s men the
slip. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You are a lucky son of a bitch.”
Vanessa tells you, picking up on your conceitedness.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I like to think of it as
intelligent decision making.” You retort proudly as you enter the terminus and
walk towards one of the huge turbo lifts which is filling with people. Vanessa
suddenly yanks you sideways by the arm.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Grimm’s men.” She hisses,
dragging you behind a pillar. You glance out from behind the pillar and sure
enough, you can see a few familiar faces picketed across the turbo lifts, eyes
searching the faces in the crowd as they board. “What now?”</p>
