out of here and find another way.” Vanessa nods her agreement and you walk
towards the terminus exit. As you step through the door, you notice the huge
frame of Grimm waiting for you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Hello again old friend.” He
grins, his men sidling up behind you and relieving you both of your blasters.
As he walks towards you, Grimm’s single eye glares malevolently at you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“No need for violence.” You tell
him, holding up your hands.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“No need,” He agrees, “But when
has that ever stopped me?” He grins before savagely smashing his forehead into
your face. You drop to your knees, tasting blood before everything goes black.</p>
