the turbo lift before they catch us.” She nods and you quicken your pace,
pushing your way through the tourists milling about in the street while
glancing back at your pursuers. Ahead, you can see the domed building which
forms the terminus for the group of turbo lifts.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Nearly there!” You breathe a
sigh of relief and glance over your shoulder. As you do, you lose your footing,
stumbling and hitting the ground hard. You wince, clutching your twisted ankle.
</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Shit!” You curse, as Vanessa
helps you back to your feet, but you can only hobble towards the dome of the
turbo lift terminus.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“So near, but so far, eh Trent?”
Grimm sneers as his cohorts surround you, snatching your blasters.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“No need for violence.” You grin,
holding up your hands.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“No need,” He agrees, “But when
has that ever stopped me?” He grins before savagely smashing his forehead into
your face. You drop to your knees, tasting blood before everything goes black.</p>
