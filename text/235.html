blaster and opening fire. Weapons fire echoes in the crowded streets as
tourists scream and run for cover. You pick off three of your pursuers before
the rest regroup and return fire. Vanessa drags you into cover behind a
fountain which crumbles around you as it is peppered by the bandits. You both
try to pick off the remaining pursuers, but they have also found cover and you
find yourselves in a Mexican stand-off. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“This was a great idea.” Vanessa
tells you sourly. “Now what?” At that moment a police flyer drops out of the
sky and hovers above you, emitting a high pitched klaxon which forces you to
cover your ears. The sound seems to have a soporific effect and you feel
yourself losing consciousness.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">You awake a few hours later,
finding yourself in a cramped holding cell. You climb down from your bunk to
find the bunk below occupied. The bulky man stirs, groaning as he sits up. His
single eye fixes on you, widening in recognition.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Sometimes dreams do come true.”
Grimm grins, cracking his knuckles as he gets to his feet and advances towards
you.</p>
