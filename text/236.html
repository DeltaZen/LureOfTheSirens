group on a guided tour. As they pass the pillar, you step out and work your way
into the middle of the throng. The tour guide, a permanently smiling Eridanian
woman, leads them into one of the turbo lifts and you cast a sideways glance at
one of Grimm’s men, his eyes scanning the crowd. As the doors close, his eyes
meet yours and widen in recognition.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Shit.” You hiss at Vanessa.
“We’ve been made.” The doors close and the lift begins its descent, but you
know they will be hot on your heels in the next turbo lift.</p>
