out from the top of a ladder at the back of the Eclipse as you race towards
him.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“All done?” You ask hopefully,
panting and clutching at the stitch in your side.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Afraid not my friend.” He
replies sadly as he secures the Eclipse’s hyperspace coil housing. “It needs
replacing.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“It’ll have to do for now.” You
tell him, glancing over your shoulder and ushering Vanessa up the boarding
ramp.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You in trouble Trent?” Hector
asks, his scaly forehead wrinkling with concern.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“No more than usual.” You grin.
“Ran into some old friends. Thought we gave them the slip, but I think they’re
hot on our heels.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Then go!” Hector tells you,
clambering down the ladder. “I’ll try and hold them up if I can.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Thanks Hector.” You nod. “You’re
a good friend.”<br class="calibre5"/>
“You might want to tell your beautiful co-pilot that.” He grins ruefully. “Now
get out of here!”</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">Moments later, you take off,
accelerating out of the hanger and banking tightly, steering straight towards
the sea below you. You pull back, trying to arc your trajectory to keep your
speed as high as possible without plunging into the depths.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Too fast!” Vanessa hisses as the
churning azure surface of the ocean rushes towards you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Trust me!” You reply with more
confidence than you feel. The waves loom ever closer and your eyes widen in
horror as you realise you may have miscalculated. You wince and brace yourself,
waiting for the bone breaking impact before the rippling waves streak by and
you can see the sky again. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Told you.” You tell Vanessa
nonchalantly, throwing her a cocky smile, before surreptitiously breathing a
sigh of relief. As you accelerate upwards, Vanessa studies the control panel in
front of her.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Looks like our friends aren’t
giving up that easily.” She tells you. “Three signals following our trajectory
and closing fast.” You nod grimly, trying to coax every last bit of power and
speed out of the aging freighter. Once you are clear of the atmosphere, you can
jump into hyperspace and they can’t follow you. It just remains to be seen
whether you can get out of the atmosphere before they blow you out of the sky
or whether the hyperspace coil will even work. A flurry of cannon fire strafes
to one side, narrowly missing you. A second burst follows and the hull creaks
in protest as you take a couple of hits. As you grit your teeth, waiting for
the coup de gras, the red haze of the outer atmosphere suddenly clears to
reveal the starry depths of space.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Hyperspace would be good.”
Vanessa tells you, panic in her voice. You stab the hyperspace button and the
inky black of space is replaced by the swirling crimson vortex of hyperspace.
This time, there is no hiding your obvious relief.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I need to find a new line of
work.” Vanessa glares at you before her temper cools and she glances at the
display before her. “What are we going to do about the hyperspace coil? It’s
not going to last forever.”</p>
