<p class="msonormal5">“Fine.” He replies, before
gesturing down to the far end of the hanger. “You know where my office is, help
yourself to refreshments.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">Several hours later, you pace up
and down in the untidy office in the corner of the hanger. Vanessa has gone
into standby mode and sits completely inanimate in the corner looking
disconcertingly like a shop mannequin or a corpse. The door suddenly slides
open and Hector steps through it, wiping his hands with an oily rag. You kick
Vanessa, who immediately comes back to life, getting to her feet.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Not good news.” He grimaces.
“The coil needs replacing. As you know, the engines on that crate are museum
pieces, so spares are not easy to come by.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Any idea where we can find one?”
You ask.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Your best bet is the scrapyard a
few islands west of here.” He shrugs. “You can’t miss it. It’s piled high with
rusting wrecks.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Great.” You reply. “Is that our
only option?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Yeah, unless you want to keep
going with the one you’ve got and hope for the best?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="239.html#Eridani_scrapyard" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">Go to the scrapyard</a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="241.html#Eridani_riskit" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">Resume your journey and hope the
coil holds out</a></p>
