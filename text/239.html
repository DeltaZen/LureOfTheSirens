<p class="msonormal4" id="calibre_pb_478"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="Eridani_scrapyard"></a>“Thanks Hector.” You tell him. “We’ll try the
scrapyard.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Sorry I couldn’t help you this
time.” He says ruefully. “Still, always a pleasure to see you my dear.” He adds
to Vanessa. She glowers at him and follows you back to the Eclipse.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">You taxi out of Hector’s hanger
and take off, weaving through the floating islands as you head west. Within
minutes, you find the scrapyard island. As Hector told you, you couldn’t really
miss it. The island is perhaps three miles in diameter, but is absolutely covered
in corroded hulks of various shapes and sizes. As you come in to land, a
rusting wing breaks away from a section of fuselage which sits precariously on
the edge, the wing section dropping several hundred metres to splash into the
sea below. You fly low over the wrecks before coming in to land in a dusty bowl
in the centre of the island.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="Eridani_scrapyardrestart"></a>You
descend the boarding ramp, clouds of reddish dust kicked up during the landing
settling all around you. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“This has got to be a low point
even for us.” Vanessa grumbles, following close behind. “Coming to this
shithole scrapyard to fix our crappy ship.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Needs must.” You shrug,
bristling slightly at the insult to the Eclipse. “Just think of that pay-out
when we reach Omega Station.” She snorts derisively in response.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">You head towards what might have
once been the mid-section of a bulk freighter, the cylindrical section of hull
torn apart at each end and hull plates missing in several places with the
corroding superstructure visible beneath. An access hatch, now permanently open
with ‘OFFICE’ painted above it in a rough scrawl beckons. You step through the
door and find a female Eridanian, wearing a flimsy purple dress sitting behind
an untidy desk. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Welcome.” She smiles rising from
behind the desk. “My name’s Xanlya. What can I do for you?” Though reptilian,
her body is humanoid in shape with slender legs, wide hips, a narrow waist and
full breasts. Despite her scaly features and hairless head, with her high
cheekbones and elfin features, you find her strangely attractive. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We’ve got a faulty hyperspace
coil.” You tell her. “We’re after a replacement if you have one?” Xanlya’s
yellow eyes glance over your shoulder, through the door at your ship.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“A T600 Freighter.” She murmurs,
frowning, deep in thought before brightening. “Haven’t seen one of those in
years. Your lucky day. We’ve got a T600 hyperspace engine just across the
landing pad. Yours for just ten thousand credits.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“It’s not worth that new.”
Vanessa gasps. “You thieving…” You put up a hand, silencing her.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Does seem expensive.” You reply,
flashing her a smile. “Three thousand seems a fair price.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You seem to be under the
impression this is a negotiation and we’ll meet somewhere in the middle.”
Xanlya smiles humourlessly. “It’s not. Ten thousand. Take it or leave it.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We only have five thousand.” You
sigh.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“That’s very sad.” Xanlya frowns.
“I guess you’re leaving it then. Unless…”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Unless?” You ask suspiciously.
Xanlya steps out from behind her desk and saunters towards you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“It’s a lonely existence here.”
She purrs, her scaly lips curling into a smile. “I might be persuaded to part
with my precious hyperspace coil for the pleasure of your company for a couple
of hours.” She runs a scaly hand over your chest.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Needs must.” Vanessa echoes your
earlier statement, a smile playing on her lips. “I’ll see you back at the ship
after you’ve finished entertaining the creature from the black lagoon.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I meant both of you my dear.”
Xanlya smiles mischievously. Vanessa’s mouth drops open and you stifle a
chuckle. It is not often she’s left speechless.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You mind if I consult with my
colleague a moment?” You ask, stepping outside and gesturing for Vanessa to
follow.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What do you think?” You ask her.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You know me,” She shrugs, “I’m
pretty open minded. Of course, if you didn’t want to fuck the lizard woman,
she’s here on her own. We could always just take it by force? The only other
option we have is to keep going with the coil we’ve got and hope for the best.”</p>
