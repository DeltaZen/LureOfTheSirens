<p class="msonormal5">“I’d prefer to establish a line
of credit.” You tell Xanlya, quickly drawing your blasters.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“No credit.” Xanlya replies
coolly. You glance at Vanessa before looking back at Xanlya.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Look, you stupid lizard, we’ve
got blasters pointed at your head.” You tell her firmly. “We’re taking the
hyperspace coil. End of story.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“No, you stupid apes,” Xanlya
replies, her yellow eyes narrowing. “I’ve got automated turrets aimed at your
heads. I’ll be dropping your corpses into the ocean and adding your little
freighter to my stock. End of story.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">Your eyes widen a split second
before automated turrets hanging down from the ceiling, hidden in the shadows
open fire, plasma bolts shredding through both you and Vanessa before you have
a chance to take Xanlya with you. Xanlya steps over your corpses, raising an
eyebrow at Vanessa’s biomechanical innards before standing in the doorway and
admiring her new acquisition on the landing pad.</p>
