hyperspace engine cowl, the replacement coil now fitted. Xanlya stands in the
doorway to her office and seeing you are ready to depart, wanders down the ramp
towards you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“It’s been a pleasure doing
business with you.” You quip, flashing the Eridanian a cocky smile.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“The pleasure was all mine.” She
grins. “I hope you have need of my services in the future as I will definitely
have need of yours.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’ve never found the thought of
engine trouble more enticing.” You laugh. Vanessa rolls her eyes and nods
towards the Eclipse.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“When you two have quite
finished.” She grumbles. You make your way up the boarding ramp and moments
later the thrusters fire and you watch the floating scrapyard drop away as you
take off and accelerate into the sky. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You think she realised you
weren't actually human?” You muse as you climb towards the outer atmosphere.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“If she didn't, she's in for a
disappointment if she thinks all humans have vibrating tongues.” Vanessa
laughs.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">A few minutes later, you are
clear of the atmosphere, the hazy outline of Eridani II just visible through
the cockpit window.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Lay in a course for the Dark
Nebula.” You tell Vanessa. “Let’s give our new hyperspace coil a good
shakedown.” Vanessa nods, her fingers gliding over the console in front of her.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Coordinates laid in.” She
confirms. “Ready when you are.” You lean forward and press the hyperspace
button. The engines hum and the stars fade away to be replaced by the
spiralling red vortex of hyperspace as you hurtle through space towards your
destination.</p>
