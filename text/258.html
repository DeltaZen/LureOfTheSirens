<p class="msonormal4" id="calibre_pb_516"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="OmegaV_start"></a>A few hours later, you drop out of hyperspace at your
destination. The constantly shifting red patterns of hyperspace are replaced by
the inky blackness and twinkling stars of normal space and just ahead of you,
the silvery grey spindle of Omega station, slowly rotating in the orbit of the
ringed gas giant, Tau Ceti IV. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Let's see if anyone's still
alive.” Vanessa grumbles. You reduce your velocity to port speed and pilot the
ship towards the station's docking bay. As you near the gaping maw of the
rectangular entrance, a loud voice booms out over the cockpit speakers.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“OMEGA STATION IS ON LOCKDOWN.
THE STATION IS QUARANTEENED DUE TO AN OUTBREAK OF THE XEVON VIRUS. REVERSE YOUR
COURSE IMMEDIATELY!”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">You ignore the warning,
continuing on towards the station.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">As you set down in the cavernous
docking bay, you can tell Omega station is in the middle of a catastrophe. One side
of the docking bay is piled high with long crates which can only be makeshift
coffins and as you follow Vanessa down the boarding ramp, there is an
atmosphere of deep despair. A dockhand hurries towards you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Get back on your ship and
leave!” He tells you. “Didn’t you hear the warning? Omega station is under
quarantine. We’ve had an outbreak of the Xevon virus here!”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You won’t want my cargo of
antidote then?” You grin.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You have the antidote!” His eyes
widen incredulously. “We weren’t expecting it for weeks!” As you open the hold
doors, he waves the other dockhands over and they immediately begin to unload
the crates of ampules containing the precious antidote.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">An hour later and the ship has
been unloaded, the crates transported to the station’s medical unit where the
antidote is distributed amongst the remaining population.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We’ve lost a third of the
station’s population since the outbreak.” The dockhand tells you. “We were
starting to worry that there would be no one left to save by the time the antidote
arrived with having to navigate around the Dark nebula.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We went through.” You tell him.
The dockhand’s eyes widen and he whistles.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“That’s a brave thing you did.”
He tells you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“It’s a stupid thing.” Vanessa
tells him. “We only just lived to tell the tale!”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Still, you did and you’ve both
saved a lot of lives.” He tells you sincerely. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You’re welcome.” Vanessa
replies, distractedly glancing around the docking bay. “Now who’s a girl got to
blow to get a drink around here?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“There’s a bar in the Astral
Hotel...” The dockhand tells her, making you wince at the mention of the
luxurious though expensive galactic hotel chain.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Nice.” Vanessa interrupts
turning to you. “I think the least you owe me is a suite in the Astral Hotel
and a few celebratory drinks in the bar.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“…though the station commander,
Administrator Drax has requested an audience.” The dockhand adds.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="290.html#ZeroG_Start" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">You're too busy. You’ve got a salvage
claim to investigate</a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="259.html#Tiedup_start" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">Go to the Astral hotel and have a
few drinks in the bar</a></p>
