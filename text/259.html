a drink at the Astral hotel’s bar.” You tell the dockhand “My partner and I
will be enjoying a well-deserved drink or ten!” Vanessa grins and you leave the
docking bay, walking the bustling wide corridors of the station towards the
commercial quarter. There is a tangible atmosphere of relief as the station’s
residents hurry past you in the direction of the medical unit to have the
antidote administered to them.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">You emerge into the brightly lit
commercial section, a vast hall lined with shops and businesses. At the far end
is the grand columned entrance to the lavish Astral hotel. You walk in,
crossing the gleaming marble floor of the lobby and entering the bar. Undoubtedly
it is a classier establishment than you are used to, with sophisticated
clientele dressed in expensive suits or glamorous dresses sipping their drinks.
You order an expensive bottle of champagne and find a table.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Well, here’s to us.” You grin at
Vanessa, raising your flute. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“To us,” The beautiful redhead
smiles, “And a long and lucrative career in salvage.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Sounds a bit dull, doesn’t it?”
You comment after a moment.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’m relieved to hear you say
that.” Vanessa chuckles. “How about selling our salvage rights and getting back
to what we do best.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I can drink to that.” You laugh,
swigging down the contents of your champagne flute and cheerfully ignoring the
look of disgust from the occupants of the next table before reaching for the
bottle.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">You stir, blinking away the fog
of sleep, wincing slightly at the mild hangover. Your eyes widen as you realise
you are blindfolded and spread-eagled on your back, your wrists and ankles
bound. From the slight draft cooling your body, you realise that you’re naked.
You pull at your bonds, but the ropes are tied tightly and securely. You can
feel a springy mattress beneath you, but beyond that, your location is a
complete mystery.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“He’s awake.” An unfamiliar
female voice comments nearby.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“About time.” A second female
replies, her voice equally unknown to you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You seem to have me at a
disadvantage.” You grin, trying to keep the fear out of your voice.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We do.” The second voice agrees
without elaborating any further. You wrack your brain, trying to think of who
you have crossed in the past that would abduct you. Most would no doubt kill
you as soon as look at you, but the two female voices should narrow it down.
Maybe that job you did all those years ago with the Takagi sisters. You
wouldn’t imagine they’d have been too pleased after you slept with each of them
without the other knowing and then made off with the loot, but that was a long
time ago. Still, hell hath no fury…</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Aki? Mariko?” You call out.
“It’s been a while.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Who?” The first voice chuckles.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Who are you then?” You ask,
feeling increasingly vulnerable as you listen to the two women moving closer to
you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You talk too much.” The second
voice tells you. “I think you would prefer it if you remain silent.”</p>
