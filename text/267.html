<p class="msonormal4" id="calibre_pb_534"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="Tiedup_end"></a>The room reeks of sex and the sheet beneath you is damp
with a mixture of perspiration and your collective juices. Hands reach behind
your head and untie the blindfold, pulling it off. You blink and squint as your
eyes slowly grow accustomed to the light and your eyes focus on faces beaming
down at you. One unfamiliar: An attractive dark haired woman while the other
you recognise immediately.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Vanessa!” You gasp in surprise.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“How’s that for a celebration.”
The redhead grins, her voice the unfamiliar tones of the mysterious second
woman.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Your voice…” You stutter,
confused.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“One of my alternate voice
settings.” She grins, her voice returning to her familiar one. “I didn’t want
to give the game away.” You look around you at the elegant furnishings of the
room and realise you must be in a suite in the Astral Hotel. Your gaze falls on
the attractive, dark haired woman, perhaps in her late thirties and wearing a
lacy black basque, her breasts spilling out of the top while a neatly trimmed
patch of dark pubic hair contrasts with the pale skin of her shapely thighs.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“This is Administrator Drax.”
Vanessa smiles.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Call me Miranda.” Administrator
Drax purrs. “I heard you were staying at the Astral Hotel and thought I would
express my gratitude in person.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Consider me gratified.” You
grin.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“My pleasure.” She smiles sexily.
The women untie you and you kiss each in turn, before you all lie back on the
bed, the women pressed against either side of you, their bodies moulded against
yours, each with an arm thrown across your chest.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Lights off.” Vanessa murmurs and
the room dims. As you lie there in the darkness, the room in silence save for
the gentle breathing of the dozing women, you reflect on a wild few days. While
you are lucky to still be alive, you have successfully crossed the Dark nebula
and registered salvage rights to all those wrecks too. You glance at Vanessa,
who intuitively flicks open her eyes, gazing back at you in the dim light. Her
lips curl into a subtle smile before her eyes close again. She might be an
android, but you can think of no other woman you would rather be with. Rich and
sandwiched between two beautiful women in an expensive suite in the Astral
Hotel, a smile crosses your face: It’s like a perfect dream. Your smile
falters, a horrible thought flashing through your mind as you remember those
writhing tendrils on the Magellan. Just as quickly, you cast the thought from
your mind. No, the organism is dead. You killed it... Didn’t you?</p>
