of hyperspace at your destination. The constantly shifting red patterns of
hyperspace are replaced by the inky blackness and twinkling stars of normal
space and just ahead of you, the silvery grey spindle of Omega station, slowly
rotating in the orbit of the ringed gas giant, Tau Ceti IV. You reduce your
velocity to port speed and pilot the ship towards the station's docking bay. As
you near the gaping maw of the rectangular entrance, a loud voice booms out
over the cockpit speakers.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“OMEGA STATION IS ON LOCKDOWN.
THE STATION IS QUARANTEENED DUE TO AN OUTBREAK OF THE XEVON VIRUS. REVERSE YOUR
COURSE IMMEDIATELY!”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">You ignore the warning,
continuing on towards the station.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">As you set down in the cavernous
docking bay, you can tell Omega station is in the middle of a catastrophe. One
side of the docking bay is piled high with long crates which can only be
makeshift coffins and as you descend the boarding ramp, there is an atmosphere
of deep despair. A dockhand hurries towards you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Get back on your ship and
leave!” He tells you. “Didn’t you hear the warning? Omega station is under
quarantine. We’ve had an outbreak of the Xevon virus here!”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You won’t want my cargo of
antidote then?” You growl.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You have the antidote!” His eyes
widen incredulously. “We weren’t expecting it for weeks!” You shrug and open
the hold doors. The dockhand excitedly waves the other dockhands over and they
immediately begin to unload the crates of ampules containing the precious
antidote.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">An hour later and the ship has
been unloaded, the crates transported to the station’s medical unit where the
antidote will be distributed amongst the remaining population.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We’ve lost a third of the
station’s population since the outbreak.” The dockhand tells you. “We were
starting to worry that there would be no one left to save by the time the
antidote arrived with having to navigate around the Dark nebula.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We went through.” You tell him.
The dockhand’s eyes widen and he whistles.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“That’s a brave thing you did.”
He tells you. “You’ve saved a lot of lives.” You nod, feeling unworthy of the
praise after it cost Vanessa her life. Still, you take some solace that her
death was not in vain. Perhaps sensing that your arrival came at a price, the
dockhand turns to leave before turning back to you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“The station commander,
Administrator Drax has requested that you report in person.” The dockhand tells
you. </p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="275.html#OmegaNV_draxstart" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">Report to Administrator Drax</a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"> </p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="274.html#OmegaNV_noshagend" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">You’ve delivered your cargo and
your work here is done. Get space bound</a></p>
