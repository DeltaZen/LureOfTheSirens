“I hope you enjoy some well-deserved R and R on my station. You’ve earned a
decent break and an opportunity to fritter away some of that money Crassus has
transferred to your account. I must admit, I didn’t trust that lizard as far as
I could throw him, but it’s been forty thousand credits well spent.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Forty thousand!” You exclaim.
“That scaly son of a bitch! He only gave me Seventeen.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">Miranda can’t help but smirk.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Not quite the businessman you
thought you were?” She raises an eyebrow. “Come and see me before you leave and
perhaps we can agree on another form of compensation.” She leans towards you
and presses her lips to yours, kissing you tenderly, the now familiar aroma of
her perfume intoxicating.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I’ll do that.” You promise after
breaking the kiss. You stride from the office, the receptionist glancing at the
clock on the wall and eyeing you suspiciously as you walk past. </p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">A few hours and several glasses
of Tritonian whisky later, you stagger from a bar in the station’s leisure
sector. All around you, similarly inebriated residents of the station are in
high spirits all having been vaccinated against the disease that had decimated
a third of the station’s population. You walk across the starlit domed plaza,
the general revelry and outpouring of relief around you at odds with your own
emotions. The drunker you are, the more melancholy you become as your thoughts
turn to Vanessa. You know you’ll miss your companion, your confidante… your
lover. You reach the edge of the plaza, leaning on a rail and gazing through the
latticework of the dome and through the large transparent walls at the starry
expanse of space beyond. You remind yourself that it’s a big universe out there
and they’ll be plenty of other women to seduce. You smile to yourself,
brightening at the possibilities. You stroll towards the exit for the docking
bay before pausing. It would be rude to leave before paying Administrator Drax
another visit…</p>
