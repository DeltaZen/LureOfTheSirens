Vanessa and the dockhand. “There’s a nebula full of salvage to exploit.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“All work and no play…” Vanessa
mutters.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You know as well as I that there
are some unsavoury characters out there who will not respect our claim to the
salvage rights.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“People like us you mean?”
Vanessa replies.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I don’t know what you mean.” You
reply, casting a sideways glance at the dockhand. “I’m a legitimate business
man. Anyway, cheer up,” You grin at Vanessa, “Once we’ve sold all this salvage,
I’ll buy you the Astral hotel!”</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">A few hours later, you drop out
of hyperspace back in the middle of the Dark nebula. You weave through the
tumbling debris, heading towards a huge starliner, the Rings of Saturn. Aside
from a few bumps and scrapes, the hull looks quite intact. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Records indicate that she was
lost in hyperspace fifty-eight years ago.” Vanessa tells you, glancing at the
screen in front of her. “She must have been drawn towards the nebula. Ship’s
passenger list shows many of the rich and famous of the time were aboard.
Manifest indicates a wide variety of valuables.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Looks like a good place to
start.” You grin, manoeuvring alongside and extending the docking tube. </p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">Having donned your spacesuits,
you make your way through the darkened corridors of the stricken vessel, the
ship completely empty. Presumably, the passengers and crew were all drawn to
the Magellan and a grim fate. As you sweep your torch beams around you, the
glimpses of the luxuriously decorated corridor hints at the splendour of the
starliner in its heyday.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“According to the plans, the ball
room is just ahead.” Vanessa tells you. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Ladies first.” You reply.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Such a gentleman.” She replies
sarcastically as she leads the way. With the ship’s generators down, there is
no artificial gravity and your magnetic boots clank on the deck as you make
your way through the ship.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Wow.” Vanessa coos, the cones of
light from your torches sweeping around the vast ballroom. The torchlight
reflects off the walls and ceiling which are covered in mirror tiles. Above
your heads a rather dishevelled crystal chandelier floats above the timber
lined dance floor which is surrounded by chrome fittings and floating tables
and chairs. “It must have really been something back in the day.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">You nod, though your mind is more
focused on the little door across the ballroom with ‘Purser’s Office’ labelled
above it and the safe within.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">Once inside, Vanessa finds a
computer terminal and interfaces with the ship’s computer, her eyes glowing
blue inside her helmet as she connects.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Generators are non-responsive,”
She tells you, “But we have enough emergency power for lighting.” The lights
flicker to life and you turn your attention to the heavy door of the safe. You
fire up your laser cutter and burn through the thick steel door, sparks
showering back at you. Finally, with a thud that echoes through the ship, the
door drops onto the floor at your feet. You reach in with the cumbersome
gauntlet of your spacesuit and pull out several safe deposit boxes and pass
them to Vanessa. She opens them one after the other. Currency from various
worlds, gold and platinum, jewellery and one filled with diamonds. Vanessa
whistles in awe.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“There must be a couple of
million credits just in diamonds!” She tells you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“And this is just the first safe
in the first ship.” You grin through the faceplate of your suit at her. “We’re
going to be able to buy our own planet once we’ve worked our way through all these
wrecks!”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You know, the atmosphere is
breathable in this part of the ship.” Vanessa tells you, reaching up and
twisting the space suit’s helmet to one side and lifting it off with a hiss.
Her red hair floats wildly around her grinning face. “So, how about we
celebrate?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="292.html#ZeroG_celebrate" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">Sounds good</a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"> </p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="291.html#ZeroG_denied" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">Maybe later. You’ve got work to do</a></p>
