scoured these wrecks.” You tell Vanessa. She pouts with disappointment,
sullenly pulling the helmet back on. As you continue to explore and catalogue
the treasure trove of valuables the ship holds, she barely speaks to you. As
you rifle through some jewellery, you allow yourself a wry smile as you are
once again surprised at how human your android companion can be. Still, you’ll
make it up to her later. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">Over the next few days and weeks,
you examine every wreck in the nebula, hiring a cargo ship and crew to
transport your salvage back to the Omega station, which has rapidly become a
bustling spaceport now passage through the nebula has been declared safe.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Well here’s to us.” You grin,
raising a glass of particularly expensive champagne as you sit with Vanessa in
the Astral hotel’s bar. She is wearing a luxurious red dress while you are
wearing a finely tailored suit. An elegant diamond necklace sparkles at her
throat and matching earrings dangle from her ears, both of you looking a far
cry from your smuggler days. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“To us.” Vanessa smiles, raising
her own glass. You both take a sip, Vanessa’s green eyes studying you. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“So, we’ve finished our salvage
work.” You remark. “You ready to do some celebrating?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I thought you’d never ask.”
Vanessa purrs, discarding her glass and getting to her feet. You take her hand
and quickly head in the direction of the hotel’s lavish Presidential suite.</p>
