with a cocky grin.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I seem to spend half my days
with my lips stretched around your cock.” She grumbles good-naturedly, already
kissing her way back down your chest.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I know what you’re thinking.”
You murmur, watching her head, wreathed in her wild red hair slowly sliding
down your body to your groin. “It’s not nearly enough.” Her groan at the bad
joke is swiftly followed by your own groan of pleasure as you feel her take
your cock between her lips. The moist warmth of her mouth envelops the bulbous
head and you feel her lips begin to slip down your length. You gaze at her naked
body floating perpendicular to yours, her lips sliding up and down your shaft
as she uses her grip on your hips to move her weightless body back and forth,
impaling her mouth on your cock. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Damn, that feels good.” You
moan, enjoying the unique feel of the zero gravity blowjob, the tension
building in your balls as you feel your climax approaching. “Oh, yes! Vanessa,
I’m going to… uhhh!” Your whole body convulses in ecstasy as your cock jerks
between her lips, pumping your seed into her waiting mouth. Vanessa sucks at
the tip, her cheeks caving in from the suction as she draws every last drop of
your pearly white seed from your balls. Your whole body jerks in pleasure with
each powerful eruption until finally your wilting cock slips from her lips.
Vanessa floats slowly away, her lips sealed around a mouthful of come. Her eyes
lock onto yours as she gulps it down, while an errant drop of creamy white seed
in the corner of her mouth floats away across the ballroom. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I can see this salvage taking
longer than I thought.” You tell her breathlessly. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You say that like it’s a bad
thing.” Vanessa grins.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">The salvage safely stored in the
hold, you retract the docking tube and begin plotting a course back to Omega
station. You sit there for a moment, gazing out at the graveyard of wrecks
which so easily could have been your tomb just a few hours earlier. Instead, it
will be the making of your fortune and a brighter future. Vanessa pads across
the floor behind you before sliding into her seat and flashing you a smile. You
gaze for a moment at the beautiful android knowing that you can think of no one
you’d rather be sharing it with.</p>
