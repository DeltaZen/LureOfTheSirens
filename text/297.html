<p class="msonormal4" id="calibre_pb_594"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="ZeroG_comeinside"></a>Your grip on her hips tightens as you reach your
climax, thrusting deeply inside her one last time before your cock erupts. Her
enhanced pussy vibrates, massaging your cock as spurt after powerful spurt
splashes inside her snug, velvety hole. Your moans of ecstasy echo around the
room as your body jerks with each powerful pulse until her magical pussy has
milked every last drop of your seed inside her. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Damn, that never gets old.” You
grin as you gently slip your softening cock from her.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“My augmented vagina or fucking
me?” Vanessa asks, cocking an eyebrow as she turns to face you, her breasts
bouncing from side to side like a fleshy newton’s cradle. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Yes.” You grin, taking her in
your arms and pressing your lips to hers. “Now, if you’ve quite finished
fishing for compliments, we’ve got work to do.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Oh yes, nothing makes a girl
feel special like knowing she’s a good fuck!” She shoots back. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Come on.” You reply,
disentangling yourself from her and kicking off the ceiling of the ballroom,
propelling yourself back towards the purser’s office and your discarded
spacesuits. “We’ve got a good haul for the day. Let’s get back to the station
and I’ll buy you a drink.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You’ll buy me a few.” Vanessa
grumbles, following close behind.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">The salvage safely stored in the
hold, you retract the docking tube and begin plotting a course back to Omega
station. You sit there for a moment, gazing out at the graveyard of wrecks
which so easily could have been your tomb just a few hours earlier. Instead, it
will be the making of your fortune and a brighter future. Vanessa pads across
the floor behind you before sliding into her seat and flashing you a smile. You
gaze for a moment at the beautiful android knowing that you can think of no one
you’d rather be sharing it with.</p>
