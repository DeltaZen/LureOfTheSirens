pulling your cock free of her. Vanessa intuitively turns around and manoeuvres
herself down your body, gripping your hips and taking your cock into her mouth.
She begins to bob her head up and down, sucking on you while her green eyes
gaze up at you expectantly. You can feel the pressure building in your balls
and at the last moment, you pull your cock from her lips. She floats backwards,
a quizzical expression on her face just as you grunt with release, your come
racing up your shaft and erupting from the tip. The elongated thick rope of
come changes shape, pulled into a sphere by the surface tension of the creamy
fluid before splattering wetly across Vanessa’s cheek. Your cock twitches again
and again, each blast forming into a sphere, like giant pearls before
flattening against Vanessa’s indignant face until the last small pearly orb
explodes against her forehead.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You’re such a romantic.” Vanessa
glares at you, the quivering globules of your thick creamy seed clinging to her
features by the surface tension.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“In zero gee, it seemed wrong not
to do it.” You grin shamelessly.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You’re a selfish prick, Trent.”
She berates you, but can’t help but smile. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You wouldn’t have me any other
way.” You chuckle. “Now let’s get out of here.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Just one question.” Vanessa
says, glancing around the vast ballroom. “How are we going to get back to our
spacesuits?” You glance towards the door to the purser’s office, the magnetic
boots still clamping them to the deck just inside. You are both floating in the
middle of the ballroom, well out of reach of everything.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I didn’t think of that.” You
shrug sheepishly. Vanessa glowers a moment before you both begin to chuckle,
your laughter echoing around the cavernous chamber.</p>
