<p class="msonormal4" id="calibre_pb_602"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="Dream_station"></a>You drop out of hyperspace in orbit around Tau Ceti
IV, manoeuvring to dock with Omega station. You have never seen the remote
station before, but find yourself a little underwhelmed by the basic structure
with various habitation modules linked together with struts. You know the
station is old, but it looks positively ancient. You manoeuvre alongside and
extend the Eclipse’s docking tube to the medical module’s airlock.</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">A few minutes later, the airlock
cycles and the door slides open. You step inside the medical module, the air
smelling strongly of disinfectant. A glass door slides open as you approach it
and you step into a ward, the rows of beds surprisingly unoccupied for a station
in the middle of an epidemic.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Where is everyone?” Vanessa
murmurs. “You think we’re too late?” </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Looking pretty deserted.” You
agree. “Hello!” You shout. “Anyone here?” You see movement out of the corner of
your eye as a figure emerges from a small stock room to your right and rushes
towards you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Thank God!” A female voice
gushes as she throws her arms around you. “I thought we might be stranded here
forever!” You prise the woman, a young blonde in a white nurse’s uniform from
you and gaze into her tear stained face.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What’s going on here?” You ask
her.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Everyone’s gone.” A male voice
replies from across the room. A man in a doctor’s uniform strides towards you
and shakes you warmly by the hand.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Dead?” Vanessa asks.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Hopefully not.” He grins.
“They’ve all left. It’s just Ffion and myself now.” The doctor is perhaps forty
years old, tall with grey flecked dark hair while the nurse, Ffion looks
fifteen years his junior. Her white uniform dress hugs her slim figure, her
slender legs clad in white stockings and her blonde hair is pinned beneath a
white nurse’s hat. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“As medical staff, we were the
only ones already immunised against the Xevon virus.” Ffion tells you, wiping
the tears from her eyes. “When the outbreak began to spread and people realised
that the antidote could take weeks to arrive, they panicked and decided to take
their chances crossing the nebula. They all boarded a bulk freighter and left
three days ago. Apart from Quentin and I, only the commander remained behind.
He died yesterday.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Sorry to hear that.” You reply. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Sorry you’ve risked your lives
for nothing.” The doctor, Quentin tells you, before leaning forward and
grinning conspiratorially: “Still, if it’s any consolation we’ve got access to
the entire station’s alcohol store to ourselves until they return...”</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">A few hours later, all four of
you are suitably inebriated. Vanessa sits next to you on one of the hospital
beds, while Ffion and Quentin sit on the bed opposite. The two medics have been
easy and pleasant company and you have had an enjoyable and relaxing evening
after the tensions of the last few days. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Are you two together?” Vanessa
asks, perhaps noticing their overfamiliar body language. Ffion and Quentin
glance at each other and laugh.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Sometimes.” Ffion giggles.
“Neither of us want to limit ourselves to a strictly monogamous relationship.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Oh.” Vanessa smiles, blushing
slightly.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“So,” Quentin grins, gazing at
Vanessa, “What about you two? Are you together, exclusive?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">You glance at Vanessa, who shrugs
noncommittally.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Kind of.” You reply warily,
though your curiosity is piqued. “Why, what did you have in mind?”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Do you really need us to spell
it out?” Ffion smiles, standing up and beginning to unbutton her white nurse’s
uniform, her cleavage slowly and enticingly revealed.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="303.html#Dreams_swing" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">Why not</a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"> </p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="302.html#Dream_nothanks" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">No, you’re not comfortable with
this</a></p>
