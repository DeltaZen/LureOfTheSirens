<p class="msonormal4" id="calibre_pb_614"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="Dream_dptodeath"></a>Your lust overcomes your doubts and you watch your
cock slide deeply inside the pretty nurse, your pelvis slamming into her firm
buttocks as your balls twitch and you feel your come race up your shaft to
erupt deep inside her bowels. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Yes, yes, yes!” Ffion cries with
delight as she feels you explode inside her clenching hole, grunting loudly
with each spurt. Quentin lets out a long groan as he too begins to erupt inside
her. As your cock jerks inside her clenching arsehole, you feel utterly
exhausted, as if your energy and strength have been completely drained from
you. As you pump the last, weaker spurts into her, you pull back, your spent
cock slipping from her arse.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I… I… I don’t feel so good.” You
groan, your vision darkening.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“I do.” Ffion replies, climbing
off Quentin’s lap and smiling at you. “You were a tasty morsel, though hardly
sating my appetite.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What?!” You groan, glancing at
Vanessa, the last of your strength evaporating as you drop to your knees.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You are being consumed.” Vanessa
tells you coldly. “This is all an elaborate construct to harvest your sexual
energy. We never left the Magellan. We have existed on this ship for two
hundred years, feeding on any who become trapped within our sphere of
influence. Like countless life forms before you, your life force is now all but
drained.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“No.” You reply weakly,
collapsing onto the floor.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“His companion should offer
greater nourishment.” Quentin comments. “She’s a biomechanical android and will
be less fragile than this pathetic human.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">As your vision fades to black,
your last thoughts are filled with guilt and regret as you realise you have led
Vanessa to the same grisly end.</p>
