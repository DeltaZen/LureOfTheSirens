<p class="msonormal4" id="calibre_pb_622"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="Dream_comeinsidevantodeath"></a>Your lust overcomes your doubts and you
thrust inside Vanessa’s pussy, desperate to reach your climax. Your limbs feel
leaden and your vision begins to darken, but you grit your teeth and bury your
cock deep inside her warm moist depths as you pass the point of no return. You
bellow with pleasure and release as your balls twitch and your come races up
your shaft to erupt deep inside her. Vanessa lets out a little cry of delight
as she feels your hot seed splashing inside her.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Yes, Trent, yes!” She moans as
you come again and again, your body feeling progressively weaker with each
eruption until you are utterly spent. Your cock slips from her pussy and you
reel away, staggering backwards and crashing into a trolley of medical
equipment. You collapse to the floor and look up at the others’ faces, all
three of them looking completely indifferent to your predicament.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Humans really are pathetic.”
Quentin comments.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Yes,” Ffion agrees, “So fragile
and weak.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Vanessa?” You reach out for her,
your head spinning. She gazes coldly down at you, ignoring your outstretched
arm.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“He is but an appetiser.” She
smiles humourlessly. “His companion is a biomechanical android and will be far
more resilient to us. We shall enjoy devouring her over the next few days.” As
your vision fades to black, your dying mind struggles to comprehend what is
happening.  For a moment, your sight clears and you find yourself lying in a
huge reactor chamber. Strange writhing red tendrils creep all over the vast
room like ivy and are wrapped around your body, pinning you to the floor. As
your body begins to shut down, you realise with a start that you are still
aboard the Magellan and that your mind must have been under the influence of a
strange organism infesting the ancient vessel. As you breathe your last
laboured breath, your deepest regret is that you have led Vanessa to the same
fate.</p>
