<p class="msonormal4" id="calibre_pb_642"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="Dream_vanessabjtodeath"></a>You give in to your desire, watching
Vanessa’s lips slide down your shaft until you feel the tip nudge the back of
her throat and push past. You let out a deep groan as her lips reach the root
of your thick shaft, her nose buried in your pubic hair.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Oh fuck!” You moan as her mouth
begins to vibrate around your cock. Your balls twitch and convulse as you feel
your seed racing up your shaft to explode deep in her throat. Vanessa pulls
back slightly, your cock continuing to spurt onto her tongue as she sucks
greedily at the tip until you are completely spent. Vanessa allows your cock to
slip from her lips and smiles at you as you slump back on the bed. Something
about her smile chills you to the core. There is no humour or warmth in it,
just a predatory grin. You try to get up off the bed, but find you no longer
have the strength to move.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Humans are so pathetically
weak.” Vanessa comments, getting to her feet.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“So true.” Quentin agrees sadly,
your vision darkening as you cling to consciousness. “If only he was a Vixian
or a Medusan, we could have fed for days.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“His companion is a biomechanical
android.” Ffion comments, gazing down at you disinterestedly. “She might yet
prove more satisfying prey.” She adds coldly as your vision fades to black. 
For a moment your sight clears and you find yourself lying in a huge reactor
chamber. Strange writhing red tendrils creep all over the vast room like ivy
and are wrapped around your body, pinning you to the floor. As your body begins
to shut down, you realise with a start that you are still aboard the Magellan
and that your mind must have been under the influence of a strange organism infesting
the ancient vessel. As you breathe your last laboured breath, your deepest
regret is that you have led Vanessa to the same fate.</p>
