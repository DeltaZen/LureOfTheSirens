you slam your cock inside her, desperate to erupt inside her tight, hot
arsehole.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You’re close aren’t you?!” Ffion
moans, clawing at her breasts. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Yeah.” You grunt, your lust not
dulled by the exhaustion that threatens to overwhelm you. Quentin and Vanessa,
her face still streaked with his come, watch on intently as you thrust deeply
into the warm, snug confines of Ffion’s arse one last time before your cock
twitches and with a long, drawn out groan of pleasure and release, you erupt
inside her.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Yes! Yes!” Ffion shrieks, her
legs clamping around your thighs, pulling you in tightly while her sphincter
grips the base of your cock, milking the come from your balls. “Come inside me.
Fill my arse with your creamy come!” It feels as though your very life force is
being drawn through your pulsing cock as it spurts again and again into the
young nurse’s bowels. Your vision begins to darken and you slump forward onto
her.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“A tasty morsel, but hardly
satisfying.” Ffion comments, pushing you off her. Your strength gone, you fall
to the floor at Quentin and Vanessa’s feet.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Vanessa?” You croak weakly,
reaching up for the redhead. She slowly shakes her head, regarding you
disinterestedly.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We’ll consume your friend soon
enough.” She replies coldly as your vision fades to black. For a moment, your
sight clears and you find yourself lying in a huge reactor chamber. Strange
writhing red tendrils creep all over the chamber like ivy and are wrapped
around your body, pinning you to the floor. As your body begins to shut down, you
realise with a start that you are still aboard the Magellan and that your mind
must have been under the influence of a strange organism infesting the ancient
vessel. As you breathe your last laboured breath, your deepest regret is that
you have led Vanessa to the same fate.</p>
