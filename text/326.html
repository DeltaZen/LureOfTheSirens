<p class="msonormal4" id="calibre_pb_652"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre" id="Cargo_load"></a>An hour later, you check the cargo has all been loaded
and seal the hold. The hydraulics whine as the hold door slowly closes, the
heavy door shutting with a deep clang that echoes around the docking bay.
Satisfied that you are ready to embark, you follow Vanessa up the ramp to the
cockpit, your eyes drawn to her firm buttocks swaying mesmerizingly from side
to side in front of you. She had started out as a Hostess droid in a nightclub
on Titan, which was why she was fitted with such specialist features. Apart
from these features, she was completely indistinguishable from a real human,
even including imperfections to sell the illusion, such as freckles, moles and
a little birthmark on the inside of her right thigh. She was in bad shape when
you found her five years ago, alone and abandoned in the boarded up interior of
the now dilapidated nightclub on Titan where you had sought refuge following a
‘disagreement’ with the local authorities. Her power source was all but
exhausted and she was in standby mode, effectively unconscious. A few more days
and the last of her charge would have wasted away and she would be returned to
her factory settings: essentially dead. You had carried her back to your ship
and charged her back up. Vanessa had been very grateful and had offered to work
with you in exchange for keeping her charged up and maintained. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You going to stare at my arse all
day?” She asks, still with her back to you as you enter the cockpit.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“How do you do that?!” You ask,
incredulous.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“A woman’s intuition.” She
replies, sliding into the co-pilot’s seat. </p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal5">Moments later, you manoeuvre the
ship out of the dock and fly out into space, watching the mining colony, fixed
like a barnacle on the side of the huge asteroid, shrinking on the rear view
screen. You fly cautiously through the asteroid belt, Vanessa using the dorsal
gun turret to blast any asteroids that tumble too close. After a tricky hour,
you clear the belt and engage the main thrusters, accelerating into the void.
You turn to the navigation computer and begin punching in the course to take
you to Omega station.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“What the hell are you doing?”
Vanessa asks as she watches you deactivate the navigation computer’s fail-safes
and plot a course through the Dark Nebula.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We’ve got to get there as
quickly as possible.” You tell her as you clear a succession of warning
messages relating to travelling through the nebula. </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“We go through the nebula, we
won’t get there at all.” She scowls.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“You’ve been spending too much
time listening to old, drunken spacedogs talking about Sirens and other
nonsense.” You reply derisively. “Besides, no one’s gone missing in the nebula
for years.” </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“That’s because no one has dared
travel through the nebula for years.” She reminds you. “Everyone thinks there’s
a black hole in the centre of it.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“That doesn’t explain how some
ships make it through unscathed.” You point out before flashing her a winning
smile. “We’ll make it through. We’ve always been lucky.” </p>

<p class="msonormal5">“Oh yes, our partnership has been
a classic rags-to-riches tale.” Vanessa replies sarcastically, sweeping an arm
dismissively around the cramped interior of the cockpit. At that moment, a red
light flashes on the console in front of you.</p>

<p class="msonormal5">“A distress signal.” You murmur,
checking the scanner. “A stricken Starliner, the Spirit of the Stars. Damn.”</p>

<p class="msonormal5"> </p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="032.html#Attend_distress" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">Respond to the distress signal</a></p>

<p class="msonormal1"> </p>

<p class="msonormal1"><a href="030.html#Ignore_distress" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre">Ignore it. You’re on a tight
schedule</a></p>
