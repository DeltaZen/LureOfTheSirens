<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre2">The Seductress of Andromeda:
A Sci-Fi Choose Your Own Erotic Story</span> </p>

<p class="msonormal1"> </p>

<p class="msonormal1">Disgraced and thrown out of the Galactic Navy, you now make
a living as a smuggler and part-time bounty hunter on the fringes of the
galaxy. When a beautiful but deadly assassin offers you the opportunity to join
her on the greatest heist in Galactic history, you have to decide whether or
not to trust her.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"> </p>

<p class="msonormal1">This Erotic choose your own story puts you in control,
utilising e-book technology to eliminate the page flicking of yesteryear and
allow you to decide the outcome. The choices you make may lead to a gruesome
death or into the arms of beautiful women, both human and alien, from the
enchanting Takagi sisters to the exotic amphibious Aquilans deep below the
surface of an ocean planet. Alternatively, your travels may lead you to
encounter an attractive but enigmatic sole survivor of an isolated research
base or discover a beautiful android woman in a dilapidated nightclub on Titan.
You may find yourself marooned on a forest planet with a gorgeous Valkyrie
woman or seduced by the pretty daughter of an Admiral. If you decide to embark
on the heist, you may also fall under the spell of the alluring seductress of
Andromeda herself, Eris the assassin.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"> </p>

<p class="msonormal1">A prequel to ‘Lust of the Sirens’ this e-book can either be
enjoyed without having read the previous book or alternatively as the backstory
of the roguish hero’s formative days working on the fringes of the law at the
edge of the known galaxy. At 110,000+ words, this Erotic choose your own story
offers a wealth of content, with its intricate branching storyline offering
several wildly different paths to multiple endings, ensuring you can read again
and again and see how events play out differently depending on the choices you
make.</p>
