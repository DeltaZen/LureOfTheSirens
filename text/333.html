<p class="msonormal1">Spring 1922. Jack Shaw enters employment as a footman at

family. He soon discovers that he his initial impression of dull rural life
couldn’t be further from the truth and that the grand old house is a hotbed of
sin and debauchery. </p>

<p class="msonormal1"> </p>

<p class="msonormal1">The Earl of Grangeborough, outwardly a Gentleman, finds a
very ungentlemanly cure for his insomnia while his wife has desires of a
forbidden nature. Their widowed daughter seeks solace in the arms of one of the
staff, while her caddish brother pursues an attractive, naïve debutant and gets
more than he bargained for.</p>

<p class="msonormal1"> </p>

<p class="msonormal1">The decadence is not confined to the family, as Jack makes
quite an impression on an attractive maid with a taste for excitement and
seduces a young, shy but eager cook. Jack quickly discovers that no one is
quite what they seem, but then he too has a secret of his own…</p>

<p class="msonormal1"> </p>

<p class="msonormal1">Inspired by the TV show ‘Downton Abbey’, The Temptress of
Upton Manor is a 41,000+ word novel which follows the erotic exploits of the
resident aristocracy and their servants.</p>
